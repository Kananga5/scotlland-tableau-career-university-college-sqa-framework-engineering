H I G H

 

Follow these recommendations to build your Agility capabilities.

 

Install and configure Tableau Server

 

Understanding how your hardware, network, databases, and applications interoperate is the first step in planning your Tableau

 

Server installation. Documenting this will give you insight for installation and configuration and ongoing platform operations.

 

1. Review the Tableau Deployment section of Tableau Blueprint.

 

2. Complete the Enterprise Architecture Survey in the Tableau Blueprint Planner.

 

3. Leverage these insights to install and configure Tableau Server. For step-by-step guidance, visit the Tableau Help

 

documentation for the Tableau Server products you're implementing.

 

4. Explore Server Rapid Start to optimize your server installation. Work with our experts to ensure a successful and stable

 

Tableau Server environment with a plan for monitoring the scalable growth of users, content, and interactivity.

 

Configure user authentication and authorization for Tableau Server

 

To deploy Tableau, you will need to define authentication and authorization protocols for users in your organization.

 

1. Review the Authentication and Authorization section of Tableau Blueprint. For more detailed guidance and

 

configuration instructions, review the Tableau Server Help documentation on Authentication (Windows | Linux).

 

2. Configure either a local identity store or an external identity store at time of install.

 

3. Choose a Tableau Server authentication method that is compatible with your identity store.

 

Manage Tableau licenses

 

Licenses should be managed according to your organization's software license processes for allocating to new Tableau users,

 

changing Tableau license levels as analytical skills increase, and reclaiming available Tableau licenses when someone leaves

 

the company.

 

1. Review the Tableau License Management section of Tableau Blueprint.

 

2. Define a process for allocating licenses to new Tableau users.

 

3. Define a process for changing Tableau license levels for current Tableau users.

 

4. Define a process for reclaiming Tableau licenses when someone leaves the company.

 

5. Enable license management features in your Tableau environment - Login-Based License Management and Grant

 

Role on Sign In - and update processes accordingly.

 

6. Document this information, and it to your Enablement Intranet.

 

Deploy client software (Desktop/Prep Builder)

 

Distributing Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder (for Creators) can be done in a few different ways. Determine and

 

document the process.

 

1. Review the Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder Deployment section of Tableau Blueprint.

 

2. Determine if you want to customize the install (e.g., no prompts, inclusion of drivers, etc.) and configure your process

 

accordingly.

 

3. If virtual desktop support is required, determine how you want to manage license deactivation.

 

4. Configure Tableau Desktop license usage reporting to gather usage information for individual instances of Tableau

 

Desktop.

 

5. Document this information, and it to your Enablement Intranet.

 

Configure back-up and restore

 

A Tableau Server administrator should perform daily backups of Tableau Server and its data. Taking these steps can help

 

ensure that Tableau Server runs with minimum loss.

 

1. Review the Back-up and Restore section of Tableau Blueprint.

 

2. Learn how to use the Tableau Services Manager (TSM) command line tool to back-up and restore Tableau data,

 

including Tableau Server's own PostgreSQL database, which stores workbook and user metadata, data extract files,

 

server configuration data, and log files.

 

3. Define a cadence for performing back ups using the TSM command line tool.

 

4. Perform back-ups in accordance with your planned cadence.

 

Monitor Tableau Server process status

 

In order to ensure continued performance, your administrator should have a process in place for monitoring the Tableau

 

Server process status and a documented plan of action for when the process is "down" or "status unavailable".

 

1. Review the Tableau Server Process Status section of Tableau Blueprint.

 

2. Determine how you will monitor, at minimum, process state changes, especially "Down" and "Status unavailable".

 

3. Define a process on how Administrators will respond if a process is not running as expected (e.g., who will support the

 

issue, where will you work the issue, how will inform affected users and keep them up to date, etc.).

 

4. If you've purchased Tableau Advanced Management, explore the Resource Monitoring Tool to gain a comprehensive

 

look at the health of Tableau Server, including process status. Contact your Account Team if you're interested in

 

Tableau Advanced Management.

 

Monitor Backgrounder jobs

 

The Backgrounder process runs server jobs, including extract refreshes, subscriptions, flow runs, and data-driven alerts.

 

Administrators and users will want to know when these processes fail so corrective action can be taken.

 

1. Review the Built-in Alerts section of Tableau Blueprint for guidance on leveraging built-in alerts to monitor for

 

background job failures.

 

2. Provide enablement to Administrators, and the Creator user base more broadly, on how built-in alerts can be leveraged

 

for process failures, such as extract refresh failures, flow run failures, etc.

 

3. Provide enablement to Administrators, and the Creator user base more broadly, on how they can reinitiate the process

 

manually using, in most cases, "Run Now".

 

4. Administrators may also want to develop similar processes using the REST API or tabcmd commands as a fail safe in

 

case process owners are out of the office.

 

5. Document guidance on how users can review Backgrounder jobs, and post this information to your Enablement

 

Intranet.

 

Configure built-in alerts

 

Alerts provide critical information about platform outages so you can take immediate action to triage the issue, communicate

 

with users, etc.

 

1. Review the Built-in Alerts section of Tableau Blueprint.

 

2. Configure notifications about system alerts and failures (e.g., process status, drive space constraints, etc.) during

 

installation.

 

3. Define a process on how Administrators will respond when an alert is triggered (e.g., who will support the issue, where

 

will you work the issue, how will inform affected users and keep them up to date, etc.).

 

Review performance thresholds

 

Administrative views are dashboards that are included with Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud and help you understand system

 

utilization and how users are interacting with content so that you can proactively monitor system activity and other scheduled

 

tasks.

 

1. Review the Administrative Views for Monitoring section of Tableau Blueprint for guidance on monitoring performance

 

thresholds.

 

2. Leverage default or custom administrative views (or utilize the Dashboard Load Times Accelerator on our Tableau

 

exchange) to understand how Tableau is performing throughout the day, including background tasks to ensure they are

 

executing on time. These views should be leveraged to inform real-time action as well as trend analysis.

 

3. Define a process on how Administrators will respond when real-time action is needed (e.g., who will support the issue,

 

where will you work the issue, how will inform affected users and keep them up to date, etc.).

 

4. Enable your teams by driving best-practice awareness into existing analytics community engagements, such as user

 

group meetings, analytics academies, and competitions.

 

5. Enact Performance Thresholds that work for your organization. Read more about this process with our blog, How to

 

Improve Dashboard Load Times with People and Processes.

 

Monitor license utilization

 

Monitoring licenses can help you administrators monitor usage and answer questions like who is using licenses, which types of

 

licenses they're using and if you need more or fewer licenses.

 

1. Review the Administrative Views for Monitoring section of Tableau Blueprint for guidance on monitoring license

 

utilization.

 

2. Define a monthly cadence for reviewing license utilization details, including usage, availability, and upcoming

 

expirations.

 

3. Review license utilization in accordance with your planned cadence.

 

Define an upgrade process, including end-user communications plans

 

Defining the when and how on upgrades across all products in the Tableau platform includes decision points around upgrade

 

frequency, version selection, and version compatibility. When these areas are addressed early, administrators can better

 

manage users' expectations, rather than having to react to business demands for new features and functionality.

 

1. Review the Upgrades section Tableau Blueprint.

 

2. Define a cadence for performing platform upgrades, including Tableau Server, Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep, and

 

Tableau Bridge.

 

3. Develop an enablement plan to prepare users for platform upgrades.

 

4. Develop a communications plan to inform users about platform upgrades, leveraging all channels available in your

 

organization.

 

5. Perform upgrades in accordance with your planned cadence.

 

6. Explore Server Upgrade where Tableau experts do the heavy lifting so you can quickly and successful upgrade your

 

environment and your team can produce deeper and more relevant findings by taking advantage of Tableau's newest

 

features.

 

Complete load test and capacity planning

 

Load testing helps you understand your Tableau Server’s capacity with respect to your unique environment, data, workload,

 

and usage profile. Capacity planning, by contrast, helps you ensure optimal Tableau Server performance and sufficient

 

capacity to handle increased workloads.

 

1. Review the Load Testing section and Capacity Planning section of Tableau Blueprint.

 

2. Define a cadence for performing load testing. In general, this should be conducted two to four times a year in

 

conjunction with upgrades and server scale-up or scale-out expansions.

 

3. Define a cadence for performing capacity planning. Depending on the size of your organization, user demand, and

 

historical growth rates, you may need to do this at 6-month, quarterly, or monthly intervals.

 

4. Perform load testing and capacity planning in accordance with your planned cadence.

 

Perform database maintenance

 

Data maintenance creates free space on the Tableau Server deployments by deleting old files, including log files, temp files,

 

and rows from the http_request table.

 

1. Review the Database Maintenance section of Tableau Blueprint.

 

2. Define a cadence for performing database maintenance.

 

3. Perform database maintenance in accordance with your planned cadence.

 

Deploy Tableau Mobile

 

Mobile business intelligence enables any user to make decisions no matter where they are. As a result, you should provide

 

users with the ability to access Tableau from anywhere.

 

1. Review the Tableau Mobile Deployment section of Tableau Blueprint.

 

2. Gather organizational requirements for enterprise apps to better understand how you can control app delivery,

 

customize the sign-in experience, configure app policies, and provide additional security and governance controls.

 

3. Document guidance on how users can leverage Tableau Mobile, and post this information to your Enablement Intranet.

 

Install add-ons and extensions on Tableau Server

 

Tableau supports a robust extensibility framework for deep and complex enterprise integrations and embedded analytics

 

solutions. Define a process for how you will leverage these capabilities in your environment.

 

1. Review the Extensibility section of Tableau Blueprint.

 

2. Determine the extent to which you want to install add-ons and extensions to be deployed in the environment.

 

3. Document guidance on how users can request the installation of add-ons and extensions, and post this information to

 

your Enablement Intranet.

Get to Know Application Security

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Describe what an application is.

    Define application security and its role in relation to application development.

 

What Is an Application?

 

If you’ve ever used a computer, you’ve used an application. To define it, an application is a computer software package that performs one or more tasks and enables direct user interaction. But let’s break down what that really means by looking at examples of applications and how we use them.

 

Applications come in many forms such as database programs, web browsers, email clients, spreadsheets, media players, word processors, and image/photo editing software to name a few. Each of these software packages allows a user to interact directly with the application. For example, when you use word processing software, you interact directly with the application when you type, delete, or copy and paste text. And, you interact with applications in different ways—whether it’s on a computer using a photo editing software package like Photoshop, interacting with a mobile app on your smartphone, or conducting business transactions on a web-based banking application. That’s pretty straightforward, right?

 

There are two ways developers create applications. They develop proprietary code that is not shared outside of an organization, or they develop code through open source projects, which are designed and developed in a public, collaborative manner with developers working together.

 

Open source applications grant developers the right to use, study, and change the software, thus allowing it to be adapted and applied to a variety of use cases. There is an entire community dedicated to developing open source projects. As someone who may be interested in becoming an application security engineer, contributing to open source projects is a great way to get practical experience in application development and security while sharpening and proving your skills. As a result, you will better understand how applications are developed and function, and start to understand the role of application security in the coding and software development lifecycle.

The Role of Application Security

 

In an organization’s technology stack, the application layer is the closest layer to the user. It allows interaction with the user and therefore provides the largest attack surface for intruders. Because of this, a relatively large number of security breaches are the result of application vulnerabilities.

 

Applications can also provide a treasure trove of personal data an attacker would love to steal, tamper with, or destroy, including personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, national identification data (such as Social Security numbers), and email addresses. This means protecting applications is a key part of cybersecurity, in order to minimize the risks of data loss and the resulting negative financial, reputational, privacy, or legal impacts for an organization and its customers.

 

Application security engineers need to think like an attacker to understand how an application could possibly be misused, while also ensuring that input provided by legitimate users is sanitized, validated, and processed safely by the application.

 

Application security engineers focus on protecting applications in order to prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive data. Since it is much easier and less expensive to find security flaws in the early stages of software development, application security engineers should gather security requirements before any design or development work begins.

 

An engineer is looking through a magnifying glass at a bug on a laptopApplication security engineers work with development teams and business units to help design, create, document, code, test, deploy, and maintain secure applications. The process of designing and building applications is known as the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Application developers are responsible for the documentation and programming (coding) steps in this process. They write the source code that causes an application to carry out its desired tasks. Application security engineers partner with application developers and others throughout the SDLC to protect applications by diagnosing, documenting, and remediating application security vulnerabilities.

 

Typically in an organization, an application developer's main objective is to produce working code as quickly as possible to meet business requirements. As a result, writing secure code is sometimes an afterthought. This is where application security engineers can be super helpful by building security into the development process so that sensitive data remains protected. In doing so, they aim to ensure that an application provides what is commonly referred to as CIA: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

 

For example, application security engineers help developers design and deploy the application in a way that requires proper authentication (to protect the confidentiality of data), transfers sensitive information securely to prevent it from being modified (integrity), and ensures that users can access their data (availability).

 

Application security engineers are often embedded within an application development team and serve as advisers to designers and developers. They ensure that application requirements include security considerations, they suggest secure authentication protocols during the design phase, they implement code reviews to check for common security vulnerabilities, they test applications before deployment, and they advise on the timing and methods for patching vulnerabilities.

 

In this unit, you learned what an application is and how application development and security functions work together in practice. In the next unit, you learn about the business impact of application security, the skills application security engineers need, and common application security scenarios.

    Explain the impact of application security on business.

    List the key skills needed to become an application security professional.

    Describe common application security scenarios.

 

The Impact of Application Security on Businesses

 

Inadequate application security can have huge negative consequences for an organization. Cyber intruders attack a variety of organizations every day in the hope of enriching themselves by extracting money, corporate information, and intellectual property. Attackers use the hijacked data to make unauthorized purchases and steal consumers’ identities.

 

If you follow the news, you know that attackers have successfully compromised applications to access data stored in the computer systems of retailers, credit reporting companies, airlines, entertainment companies, government offices, schools, and many other organizations. In one case, a hotel chain was breached by a foreign country. In another case, a SQL injection attack, which we’ll cover later, installed spyware on a company’s computers which exposed customer credit card information. In multiple cases, intruders stole credit card data by taking advantage of weak data encryption systems. In total, these attacks exposed the personal information of hundreds of millions of customers.

 

These security breaches resulted in direct economic impacts from fraud and theft, but a security breach can also yield indirect economic impacts, like the loss of reputation. This can produce additional financial consequences on the business due to a loss of customers, reduced shareholder trust, and damaged brand image. Security breaches can also have legal and regulatory ramifications that result in fines and sanctions.

 

Application security engineers have a critical role to play in ensuring that customer data is adequately protected by business applications. Because the role of an application security engineer is so important, they need to have a wide range of proficiencies. Let’s dig into this a bit more to see what skills an application security engineer needs.

Application Security Engineer Skills

 

Imagine that you’re going to fly to a distant island for a tropical vacation. Before you board your airplane, you must pass through multiple airport security checkpoints. Security personnel check your ID and boarding pass, you walk through a metal detector, your luggage is X-Rayed, you pass airport security dogs, and security guards monitor TV screens to watch for unusual activity. These are layers of security at the airport to ensure that you enjoy a safe trip to your destination. Similar to the security personnel at an airport, an application security engineer must be aware of attacker entry points and provide the necessary safeguards against vulnerabilities at each phase of the application’s development and deployment.

 

Airport security personnel check travelers and luggage

 

Reports from security associations (ISC)² and Information Systems Security Association International (ISSA) discuss the cyber security skills shortage that has been growing for years. An increase in security incidents has led organizations to report an acute need for application security professionals to protect applications and data. In light of this and the fact that application security engineers require more training, an application security engineer can often earn more money than application developers.

 

Application security engineers employ various techniques at different stages of an application’s software development lifecycle (SDLC) to uncover security vulnerabilities. In order to do this, an application security engineer must have a good grasp of many technical skills, which include:

 

    Threat modeling: Think about how attackers can compromise a system and what protections are needed against them

    Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC): Help developers write secure code that minimizes vulnerabilities by implementing secure coding standards, techniques, and best practices

    Security code reviews: Identify security vulnerabilities in source code before an application is deployed to production

    Vulnerability testing and analysis: Discover weaknesses once an application is deployed and advise development teams on remediation

 

Since application security engineers work with various people (application developers, testers, designers, and others), they need to be good collaborators and communicators. They also need to be good writers since they generate documents that explain their technical findings. In some cases, they need to use their persuasive powers to convince management why a certain security feature should be installed before an application is deployed. Often, they must use their critical thinking skills to determine the various ways that an intruder would try to attack an application. Then they need to find creative solutions to thwart potential attacks. If an intrusion occurs, they investigate the incident to help identify the source of the compromise and harden the application against future attacks.

 

On top of the skills listed above, the following certifications can bolster an application security engineer’s knowledge.

    Secure Software Practitioner (SSP)

    Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation

 

If you’re considering a career as an application security professional, earning a college degree in computer science is a good way to start on that path. Application security engineers will often start out as application developers and then transition into the cybersecurity field. Also, multiple colleges offer degrees in cybersecurity. It’s definitely an exciting field with many opportunities.

 

Now that you know about the skills you need to be an application security engineer, let's look at what common security scenarios an application security engineer encounters and how to protect applications in these situations.

Common Application Security Scenarios

 

Cybercriminals look for the easiest access to steal, modify, or destroy data that requires the least amount of effort and provides the biggest payback. The more complex an application is, the higher the probability that it contains security vulnerabilities. Applications, especially web applications, are targets of cybercriminals because they present a large and relatively easily exploitable attack surface (the user interface) that can allow an intruder to access sensitive information stored on a computer. Also, intruders do not need any special tools to attack a web application. All they need is a computer and an Internet connection.

 

While attackers are trying to figure out how to infiltrate an application, application security engineers are focused on minimizing vulnerabilities in application code and ensuring application components are securely configured in order to prevent unauthorized access to customer accounts and data. A valuable resource to consult when reviewing applications security risks is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). OWASP is an international organization that provides freely available information focused on improving software security.

 

So, what are some common risks an application security engineer may encounter? An injection attack is a good example and occurs when there is improper sanitization of application inputs. In an injection attack, an intruder inserts code, instead of expected input data, into the applications input handling logic (the code that manages communication between an end user interface and a database).

 

If the application is written incorrectly, the application will run the code that the attacker injects. For example, structured query language, known commonly as SQL, could be entered into an email address field on a web page. SQL is a language used in programming and is designed to manage data. If there is no check on the input field, an attacker might be able to extract information (like health records) from the application’s database by using the SQL code.

 

To sanitize a user’s input, an application should ensure that the application handles user input as data instead of commands and includes only allowlisted characters (an allowlist is a list of characters that are granted access to a system). When an allowlist is used, all other entities are denied access, except those included in the allowlist, and those that don’t exceed the maximum data field lengths.

 

Other responsibilities of application security engineers are reviewing, testing, and verifying code during the development process to ensure user inputs are properly sanitized in order to help prevent against the injection attack described above. This is especially critical in the context of agile software development, which seeks to deliver application functionality faster than other development methods. But the agile method adds complexity because it requires continuous updating of applications to keep up with end-user expectations. Developers are expected to provide new features and fix discovered bugs at a rapid pace. Applications must be hardened to prevent exploits, and it's the application security engineer’s job to advise the development team on the most efficient way of doing so.

 

Weak, or nonexistent, encryption is another prevalent application security shortcoming that can allow attackers to expose sensitive data. Applications are vulnerable when they use protocols like HTTP that transmit data as clear text. Instead, applications should use secure protocols like HTTPS that encrypt data transmissions, so the data can’t be read without the proper decryption key. Old, weak encryption algorithms and internally developed encryption functions should be avoided. Instead, application security engineers should rely on secure, standards-based encryption algorithms.

 

Application security engineers help developers follow a Secure SDLC process. They adopt secure application design and architecture techniques based on well-known security practices, which include providing strong authentication and authorization and employing secure session management to prevent unauthorized access.

 

Application security engineers deploy applications that prevent users from logging in with default credentials, since this is a common attack vector. They sanitize user input to hinder injection attacks. Some data breaches have succeeded due to weak encryption, so application security engineers use strong algorithms with appropriate encryption key management to encrypt data transmissions and stored data (data at rest). Then if attackers infiltrate the system, they can’t extract any useful information since they won’t know how to decrypt the data.

 

Application security engineers ensure that errors are handled properly so that no sensitive information is released to the user. They also perform static and dynamic application security testing during and after application development and monitor the application for any unusual activity after deployment.

Sum It Up

 

In this unit, we covered how an application security breach can impact a business, what skills application security engineers need, and explored common application security scenarios. Next, let’s discuss the first step every good application security engineer takes: identifying the applications in their environment, and their associated risks.

Understand Network Security

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Describe what a network is.

    Identify ways people and assets access a network.

    Explain network security engineering.

 

What Is a Network?

 

A network is a fabric of interconnected elements that are related to each other. We encounter a variety of networks on a daily basis. Networks allow us to travel, to connect with other people, to view entertainment content, to collect and disburse information, and so much more. Similarly, a computer network connects two or more computers with various devices in order to share resources among people and other computers. Computer networks consist of many devices: servers, routers, computers, printers, scanners, and so on. We access computer networks to check social media, read email, review our bank account balance, and perform countless other functions.

 

In this module, we get to know Jim and Florence who are network security professionals. We learn about their job responsibilities, plus the skills they need and the tools they use to protect computer networks from potential security threats.

 

A phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop are connected to a Wi-Fi network.

How People and Devices Access a Network

 

Because we live in an interconnected world, it’s important to understand how computer network access works. It’s also imperative that we protect these networks since we rely on them every day. Let’s look at how encryption and authentication help to protect networks.

 

Some computer networks are public and some are private. A public computer network allows anybody to connect to it. You access a public computer network whenever you connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot at a coffee shop or inside an airport. A private computer network has restricted access. It allows only certain people and devices to connect to it. In this way, a private network regulates who and what can access its resources. Businesses operate private networks that allow their employees to communicate with each other and access internal, company-related information.

 

Since we don’t want just anybody to access our personal information, like our bank account balance, websites use authentication and encryption to protect network access and data transfers. To check your account balance, your bank requires that you prove who you are—this is authentication.

 

Encryption converts data from standard text into coded data that is not humanly readable. This ensures that nobody else can retrieve your private data that is being transmitted across a public computer network. Websites use encryption to protect the information that’s passed between your device, for example, your cell phone and your bank. Many websites use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) to encrypt data.

 

Now let’s check in with Florence. She’s a network security engineer at a large bank that serves customers in multiple countries. Part of Florence’s job is to ensure that only an authorized account holder can access his or her account. Her bank adopted an authentication process that requires the account holder to provide a username and password, or a debit card and a PIN (personal identification number), to log in to their account.

 

Florence also implemented multi-factor authentication, known as MFA. To access their account with MFA, a customer provides their username/password and is then required to verify their identity with an additional authentication factor, such as an authenticator app or security key. MFA provides an added layer of security that helps prevent unauthorized access to bank accounts.

Understand Network Security

 

We expect computer networks to be available and secure 24 hours a day so we can access them whenever and wherever we want. When computer networks are unavailable, it affects how we conduct our daily lives. If your bank’s computer system is unavailable, you may be unable to pay your bills (ouch!) or transfer funds to the appropriate account.

 

Because of the massive amount of personal, health, financial, and other data stored on computer networks, securing public and private computer networks is essential. As a result, network security professionals build multiple layers of security into their computer systems to provide what is commonly referred to as CIA: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

 

Many types of people may try to gain unauthorized access to a computer network. These range from hackers who want to gain access for fun or fame, to cybercriminals who want to steal money and information, to cyberterrorists who want to disrupt and damage.

 

As a network security engineer at a medical clinic, Jim knows health records are a prime target for cybercriminals. Any security breach can have legal and regulatory ramifications resulting in fines and sanctions. To minimize those risks, Jim uses hardware and software tools that provide added layers of protection for patients.

 

While Jim is aware that external cybercriminals want to attack his systems, he knows that threats can also arise internally from intentional and unintentional actions by employees or other authorized users. This can arise from a malicious insider (like a disgruntled employee) or accidental deletion by an uninformed user. Because of this, it’s critical that he knows his system configuration and typical usage patterns so he can recognize potential security threats. In many cases, internal attacks are often accidental occurrences, so the best way to deal with them is through cybersecurity education and awareness for all employees.

 

Stadium ticket takers check tickets as sports fans wait in line.

 

In the end, it’s the network security professional’s job to ensure a computer system’s CIA by keeping out unwanted intruders while providing authorized access to those who need it. Network security professionals are not always the most popular people in an organization because the security measures that they employ can make network access a bit of a challenge. Think of their job as being similar to a stadium ticket taker. This person causes a slowdown in the stadium entry process that can result in ticket holders having to wait in line. But the ticket takers fill an important role by ensuring that each person who enters the stadium has a valid ticket.

Describe the Healthcare Technology Landscape

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Describe the healthcare technology landscape.

    Identify the main goals of healthcare industry organizations.

    Define key healthcare technologies.

    Define key cybersecurity terms used in the healthcare industry.

 

What Is Healthcare Technology?

 

Most people use healthcare technology (healthtech) every day even if they don’t know it. From wearable devices such as smartwatches that track heart rate to the Internet of Things (IoT) to track insulin levels in diabetes patients, healthtech’s use is widespread and continues to grow at a rapid pace. But what is healthtech and why is it important?

 

Healthtech is the use of technologies developed for the purpose of improving all aspects of healthcare. These technologies include digital devices, software, and tools designed to support healthcare organizations, doctors, and patients, with the goal of enabling people to access, exchange, and manage healthcare information electronically.

 

A woman holds a mobile phone with a first aid kit symbol, and is surrounded by circles depicting a smartwatch with a blood pressure measurement.

 

Healthtech improves patients’ quality of care by increasing the productivity and efficiency of hospitals and other healthcare organizations. By turning over recurring and monotonous tasks to powerful computers, the technology lessens the burden on healthcare professionals and allows them to focus their goals on improving healthcare for all.

Goals of Healthcare Organizations

 

When it comes to quality healthcare, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. In fact, personalization and customization are key as no two people are alike. Tailoring everything from medication to exercise regimens amplifies human health. Healthtech is such a transformative practice that its impacts are causing a lasting change across the globe.

 

In general, healthtech aims to:

 

    Improve the patient experience.

    Improve people’s health.

    Reduce the per-person cost of healthcare.

 

Healthtech supports these aims by expanding options for medical treatments while transforming how medical professionals execute their jobs. It also provides patients with tools for managing their health independently and together with their healthcare practitioners.

 

As an enabler of the medical profession principle, “First, do no harm,” healthtech introduces new technologies that, when properly secured, increase patient health by reducing medication errors and improving compliance. For example, pharmacists can use healthtech to improve patient safety by identifying prescription drug conflicts through data correlation of a patient’s allergies with prescribed medications. Healthcare practitioners can use healthtech to access and update patient health records and exchange patient care data with colleagues rapidly for collaboration efforts, secondary opinions, and evaluations.

Key Healthcare Technologies

 

Healthtech is already becoming integrated into every fabric of the healthcare industry from administrative processes to cancer research and drug development. Healthcare practitioners can leverage these technologies to make the patient experience as painless as possible while improving overall human health. Let’s take a closer look at some healthtech applications in the areas of administrative processes, drug development, surgery, IoT, and telehealth.

 

Administrative Technologies

 

Administrative technologies allow hospitals and healthcare organizations to manage their growing administrative workloads and tasks such as scheduling and documenting patient care. Let’s look at a few of these technologies.

 

    Artificial intelligence (AI) streamlines patient workflows by calculating wait times and predicting peak busy hours thus enabling improved scheduling and prioritization of appointments.

    Electronic medical records (EMR) emulate a patient’s paper chart and contain the patient’s medical and treatment history from one medical practice into a digital version.

    Electronic health records (EHR) contain the totality of a patient’s health record, consist of the patient’s EMR from multiple doctors, and represent a long-term view of a patient's health in digital form.

 

Drug Development Technologies

 

The pharmaceutical industry leans heavily on AI and machine learning (ML) to power a new wave of drug research and development by automating manual tasks such as combining certain chemicals to create the optimal drug.

 

Surgical Technologies

 

Surgical and recovery times are drastically reduced thanks to numerous technologies. Let’s look at a few common applications.

 

    Robotics removes the dependence of solely onsite doctors for care. Robotic surgical assistants are often used in tandem with an onsite doctor to perform processes from non-invasive procedures to open-heart surgery.

    Virtual reality (VR) allows aspiring surgeons the use of augmented VR (a real-life view of an experience projected onto a screen) to gain experience on conducting several different types of surgeries or practicing new surgical techniques.

    Three-dimensional (3D) printing increases the number of available organs for transplants. 3D printing is changing the world of organ transplants by allowing for the substitution of certain organs and artificial tissue with 3D printed solutions to replace or repair damage or structures in the body.

 

IoT Technologies

 

IoT consists of a network of internet-connected objects able to collect and exchange data. The technology offers new opportunities for healthcare professionals to monitor patients, as well as patients to monitor themselves. Some examples of these health monitoring devices include connected inhalers and glucose monitoring.

 

    Connected inhalers help treat conditions such as asthma by monitoring a patient's frequency of attacks and collecting environmental data for their healthcare provider to understand what triggered the attack. These inhalers also alert patients if they leave inhalers at home or when they use the inhaler improperly.

    Glucose monitoring in diabetic patients has traditionally been difficult. Patient's have to manually check and record their glucose regularly often at inconvenient times. These checks typically represent a snapshot in time. IoT devices for glucose monitoring provide continuous, automatic monitoring of glucose levels and eliminate the need for manual record keeping, while alerting patients when their glucose levels are problematic.

 

Remote Patient Monitoring and Telehealth

 

These are probably the most common applications of healthcare IoT devices. These devices automatically collect health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, or temperature from implanted or wearable medical devices from patients not physically present in a healthcare facility. Software applications manage, save, and forward the collected data to a medical professional anywhere in the world where an internet connection and access to the application exist.

Healthcare Cybersecurity Terminology

 

With all these advancements in healthtech, cybersecurity has become more vital than ever for the healthcare sector. Yet cybersecurity threats to the healthcare industry are rapidly on the rise. Financially motivated criminal organizations and other threat actors continue to target the healthcare industry with ransomware attacks and data theft, which puts patient safety and privacy at risk. It’s therefore critical to view cybersecurity as a patient safety issue, enterprise risk, and strategic priority. Before we dive a bit deeper into these threats and risks, let’s learn about a few cybersecurity related terms the healthcare industry uses.

Get to Know the Energy and Utilities Industries

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Describe the energy and utilities industry.

    Discuss the current energy and utilities industry outlook.

 

The Energy Industry at a Glance

 

Before the industrial revolution, our energy needs were modest. For heat, we relied on the sun, or we burned wood and straw. For transportation, horses gave us mobility, and wind in our sails helped us explore the world.

 

For a hundred years, energy consumers had one option for service. Utility companies didn’t have to compete for customers, and customers couldn’t shop around for utility services. Utilities offered one service, electricity, and everyone wanted it.

 

Today, many customers have different options, including the type and source of energy they buy, and whom they buy it from. They can shop for rates and energy-efficient appliance rebates to suit their energy needs.

 

In a deregulated market, customers enjoy greater freedom in shopping for utility services, because deregulation increases competition, and competition multiplies customer choice. This means multiple utility companies compete to provide better services to customers. As they say, competition in a market is always good for customers.

 

Add customer demand to this. Today’s customer expects to engage their utility provider for other reasons, not just to report outages to the call center. Customers now want digital services such as:

 

    Status updates through social media

    Online bill payment

    Incentives and offers over self-service mobile channels

 

In fact, customers want to be informed through all available communication channels, such as text, email, and social media.

 

They no longer depend solely on utilities for their energy needs, because they can get their energy from non-utility companies too. For instance, some tech and automobile companies are also offering utility services to consumers like never before.

 

Consumers can also generate electricity themselves by using solar panels and wind turbines. So, utilities aren’t only competing with non-utility companies but also customers to own the energy-customer relationship.

 

Most of the earth’s population relies on electricity, gas, and water supply. For this reason, the opportunities to serve billions of customers with better and faster services are endless.

Energy and Utilities Industry Outlook

 

The global energy and utilities industry includes three major categories of natural resources: electricity, natural gas, and water. The industry is responsible for the safe, secure, reliable, and sustainable generation, transmission, and distribution of these resources. The key industry segments are:

 

    Generation

    Transmission and distribution

    Customer or retail

    Water distribution

    Natural gas transmission and distribution

 

A power plant, solar panels, windmills, transmission tower, and a house.

 

A value chain is the complete set of activities starting from energy generation, transmission, marketing, and finally distribution to retailers and customers. An efficient value chain creates economic value for customers, employees, and society at large.

 

You need a robust distribution network to guarantee a stable supply of energy to customers. Energy production, marketing, and promotion are activities that are now open to competition. However, power distribution is still a cost-managed monopoly business in most parts of the world. Government-owned entities usually manage the power distribution business, which has a slightly different value chain compared to the privately managed ones.

 

Renewable energy has been gaining momentum in the electricity industry as the infrastructure and logistics for generating electricity from renewable sources become cheaper and more accessible. Renewable energy uses naturally replenished sources, such as the sun, wind, water, the earth’s heat, and plants. Renewable energy plays an important role in the world’s energy security and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

 

The energy and utilities industry faces several challenges, such as:

 

    New and more stringent regulations

    Nuclear vulnerability in some countries

    Security-related issues around the transport of raw materials

 

To grow in these conditions, companies must digitally transform, reorganize, and change their action plans. This means investing in new technologies and methodologies, including information analytics.

Explore Types of Utility, Energy, and Waste Companies

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Identify the different types of utilities.

    Describe the types of utility, energy, and waste companies.

 

Utilities Basics

 

Take a look at the three types of utility products and how utility companies work to produce the products and transport them to customers.

Electricity

 

Electricity starts with generation. Traditional power generators are utilities that produce electricity from fossil, nuclear, and renewable energy sources.

 

This image shows the electricity production and distribution process.

 

The electricity production and distribution process.

 

After power is generated, it’s often transformed from low to high voltage, so that transmission lines can efficiently carry it over long distances. When power nears its final destination, distribution transformers convert high-voltage power back to low voltage and deliver it to customers at end usage points. Some large commercial and industrial customers draw power directly from transmission lines.

 

In some markets, customers create their own power using distributed energy resources (DER) systems. DERs are small-scale power generation or storage systems located close to where the electricity is used, such as in a home or business.

 

Energy retailers, also called vertically integrated utilities depending on the market, sell electricity to customers. Some customers generate and store their electricity on-site with photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, electric vehicles (EV), and microgrids. They can also sell their energy back to utilities.

Gas

 

Natural gas is a nonrenewable hydrocarbon gas used as a source of energy for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. The natural gas production journey involves several complex stages. First, companies extract fossil fuels and biofuels. Next, they process the fuels using odorification, compression, metering, and finally liquefaction. Lastly, companies sell the processed gas to the commodity market.

 

This image shows the production and distribution process of natural gas.

 

The natural gas production and distribution process.

 

Transmission networks move high-pressure gas to large industrial customers, gas-powered electricity generators, or storage. Storage facilities hold the gas reserves.

 

Distribution companies receive gas from transmission companies and deliver it to their customers. Depending on the market, distribution companies sometimes operate as a regulated monopoly or a competitive retail company. In a competitive gas market, retailers and gas suppliers sometimes purchase gas from the distributors and pay them to ship it to the customer's premises.

Water

 

In this image, observe how water is sourced and distributed to customers. The image also shows how utilities collect wastewater from customers and send it for treatment.

 

The water-sourcing and distribution process.

 

Utilities source water from rivers and reservoirs, water-treatment plants, and service reservoirs by abstraction and treatment. They store the treated water in storage facilities before transporting it to customers.

 

Similar to gas, in a deregulated water market, a retailer or utility company purchases water from the distributor and pays them to ship it through a clean water network for household or commercial consumption. The retailer has contracts with the customer and is responsible for billing water consumption and waste discharge. Wastewater is sent back into the system through a wastewater network for treatment and storage at sewage or sludge-treatment facilities.

Types of Utility, Energy, and Waste Companies

 

Now that you know more about how utilities function, examine the players that serve the utility service needs of customers. This section focuses on the electricity industry, but the gas and water industries have similar counterparts.

Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution Companies

 

Power generation, transmission, and distribution companies specialize in creating, transmitting, and distributing energy and utilities.

 

A power plant, electricity transmission tower, electricity distribution pole, and a transformer.

 

Power generation companies generate electric power from primary sources of energy, such as solar, wind, nuclear, coal, oil, and natural gas. For utilities in the electric power industry, power generation is the stage before storage or delivery to customers through transmission, distribution, and so forth.

 

Transmission companies specialize in the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site to an electrical substation. At this point, distribution companies take over using interconnected lines known as a transmission network. The combined transmission and distribution network is commonly known as the Grid in North America and the National Grid in the United Kingdom, India, Tanzania, Myanmar, Malaysia, and New Zealand. Transmission companies are often combined with or serve as distribution companies.

 

Distribution companies deliver electric power by carrying electricity from the transmission system to individual customers. Distribution substations connect to the high-voltage transmission system and use transformers to lower the transmission voltage to medium voltage ranging between 2 kV and 35 kV.

Electric Suppliers and Retailers

 

Electric suppliers and retailers are companies that buy electricity from the commodity market and sell it to customers. In many countries, the electricity market has been deregulated to open up the supply of electricity to competition. The role of electricity retailing has changed from administrative in integrated utilities to revenue-generation and risk-management in today’s competitive electricity market.

 

Electricity retailers now offer their customers fixed or variable prices for electricity and manage the risk involved in purchasing electricity from spot markets or electricity pools. In a deregulated market, also called a competitive or liberalized energy market, customers can:

 

    Choose from several competing electricity suppliers.

    Purchase electricity sourced from renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar.

    Buy other related products and services.

 

Electric Cooperatives

 

Electric cooperatives (co-ops), are private, nonprofit utility businesses owned by the customers they serve. Co-ops provide at-cost electric service and are governed by an elected board of directors. The two types of cooperatives include distribution cooperatives and generation and transmission (G&T) cooperatives.

 

    Distribution cooperatives deliver electricity to their member-owners.

    G&Ts provide wholesale power to distribution co-ops through their own generation or by purchasing power on behalf of the distribution members.

 

Co-ops are typically established in rural areas that don’t have an investor-owned or municipal utility nearby to supply electric power. Examples of electric cooperatives include Great Lakes Energy Cooperative in Michigan and Dixie Power in Utah.

Energy Services Companies

 

Energy services companies (ESCOs) design, develop, build, and arrange financing for projects that save energy, reduce energy costs, and decrease operations and maintenance costs at their customers’ facilities. In general, ESCOs act as project developers for a comprehensive range of energy conservation measures (ECMs) and assume the technical and performance risks associated with a project.

Investor-Owned Utilities

 

Investor-owned utilities (IOUs) are privately owned electricity and natural gas providers that aim to produce a return for investors. IOUs distribute profits to stockholders or reinvest the profits. A public utilities commission regulates and sets the rate with some customer participation. IOUs purchase power through contracts and also have their own generation facilities. They’re the largest type of electric utility and have a complex mix of customers. Examples of IOUs include FirstEnergy in Ohio and Pacific Gas & Electric in California.

Public Utilities

 

Public or municipality-owned utilities are nonprofit local government agencies. They provide services to communities that recover costs and earn additional returns. Public utilities use the returns to invest in new facilities. Locally elected officials or public employees manage public utilities.

 

Public utilities can return excess funds to customers through reduced rates, community contributions, and increased operational efficiencies. The utility governing body or city council sets the rates. Public utilities operate their own generation facilities or buy power through contracts. Examples of public utilities include Breckenridge Public Utilities in Minnesota and Burlington Electric Department in Vermont.

Summary

 

In this unit, you learned about the different types of utility products and how utility companies produce and distribute their products. You also got to know that many types of utility companies operate worldwide, including investor-owned, municipality-owned, and cooperatives. These companies strive to meet the energy, gas, water, and waste needs of communities.

 

In the next unit, you learn how these companies operate within their markets.

Discover Market Models and Their Impact on Utilities

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Explain the different types of global utility market models.

    Discuss the challenges that utilities face today.

    Describe the impact of processes required by key business units.

 

Types of Global Utility Market Models

 

Energy markets across the world are in the middle of a revolution, triggered by decarbonization and fueled by innovation. Some countries have introduced energy deregulation and competition into energy markets, which has led to the creation of new types of energy markets. Here’s a look at some of the globally recognized energy market models.

Regulated

 

A stamp and document symbol.

 

Utility companies in regulated markets, often called vertically integrated utilities, must show a return on investment or a benefit for the money they spend. In a regulated market, the utility companies own the infrastructure, which includes electric transmission lines and all the associated equipment, such as power poles, power lines, and transformers. These utility companies often generate or purchase electricity and sell it to customers.

Regulated with Competition

 

A stamp, document, and people symbol.

 

Utilities in a regulated competitive market are similar to regulated utilities, but they face some level of energy supplier competition. This type of market model often caters to the customer base with higher usage or demand.

 

Some regulated markets support a level of energy supplier competition. Utilities in regulated markets are often considered vertically integrated, which means they have a monopoly over the sale of power to their customers. But in many regions, utilities offer limited choices for some customer segments. Examples of such regions in the US include California, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, and Virginia.

 

Sometimes residential customers buy power from the community or renewable-energy suppliers. In many cases, commercial and industrial (C&I) customers with high usage and demand buy power from energy suppliers that can meet their operational budgets and sustainability goals with clean energy.

Transitioning

Transitioning markets are now open to full-scale competition. However, these markets haven’t fully separated or unbundled all of the existing entities of the previously regulated market. Entities include generation, transmission, distribution, and retail.

Competitive

 

A document and people symbol.

 

Competitive markets are also known as deregulated energy markets. In a competitive market, utility companies own and maintain the transmission infrastructure and distribute electricity, while other companies compete to supply and sell electricity and gas to customers.

 

In a deregulated market, vertically integrated companies are split into multiple independent companies that focus on a specific aspect of the market. For example, a single vertically integrated utility company is split into generation, transmission and distribution, and energy supply companies, though this varies between markets. Additionally, services such as meter asset management and meter ownership are sometimes split into separate companies.

 

The goals of energy deregulation typically include breaking up monopolies and encouraging energy supplier competition. This gives customers more options and encourages price competition. A successful deregulated market has some churn because customers mostly shop for competitive rates and offers that fit their needs and lifestyles.

Challenges Facing Utilities

 

The energy and utilities industries face many obstacles due to the current business environment. Consolidation is creating an increasing need to integrate, merge, and reconcile business-support systems. Here’s an overview of the industry environment and the challenges it presents.

Deregulation

 

Around the world, countries have introduced energy deregulation and competition into energy markets to democratize the energy and utilities industry and provide customers with choices. The more competitive a market, the more pressure on utilities to gain and retain customers.

 

Deregulation:

 

    Increases customer choice and energy supplier competition to encourage competitive energy pricing.

    Unbundles generation, transmission, distribution, supply, and customer service.

    Helps break up monopolies over the end-to-end elements of electricity, gas, and water supply.

 

Aging Infrastructure and Workforce

 

Along with competitive pressure, the energy and utilities sector is at an inflection point. Aging infrastructure needs replacement, and a new generation is entering the workforce. In addition to the physical infrastructure, aging and inflexible customer information systems (CIS) and billing systems can no longer handle the data and security requirements of changing markets.

Retail Competition’s Effect on Energy Rates

 

Competitive markets lead to price competition, and the commercial and industrial segments benefit the most. Even customers using default services provided by utilities in competitive regions still benefit from competitive markets, because competition leads to more choices.

Climate Change and Environmental Responsibility

 

Everybody's talking about climate change. The implementation of energy savings and efficiency measures, and the use of renewable energies, are constantly increasing. That’s why utility companies must rethink their strategies and shift their operations to reach greater levels of environmental stewardship and protection. When it comes to finding new ways to generate energy through sustainable processes, it’s now or never.

 

Furthermore, energy sustainability measures open the door to major economic benefits. Sustainability measures can help generate mass amounts of information with valuable consumption and generation data to bring down costs.

Digital Transformation

 

Digital adoption and rapid technological change are forcing utilities to rethink their current business models, including how they work and the services they provide. To achieve greater sustainability and higher energy savings, utilities have to implement digitization strategies that facilitate the design, implementation, and operation of new sustainable technologies in which customers play a starring role.

 

Customers expect to have a more fluid and personalized experience. What’s more, they want more information, with detailed data on their rates and consumption. Utilities must make their strategies customer-centric and digitize their processes and tools.

Key Business Units and Processes

 

The rules of the energy industry are changing as utilities embrace new technologies and customers gain more control over products. Examine some of the impacts of changes to business processes on customers and key business units.

Accounting Rules Changes: Information Services

 

Often, utilities in regulated markets are unable to capitalize on the money they spend on services in the same way that they can for capital equipment. Because regulated markets lack competition, utilities haven’t prioritized information services, such as cloud-computing solutions to support their business processes. However, this is changing as some utilities acknowledge the benefits provided by software as a service (SaaS).

Utility Rules Changes: Who Creates Energy?

 

Now customers really do have power, their own power. With rooftop solar, electric vehicles, batteries, and microgrids, customers can sell their power back to the grid. They can also get paid by utilities to reduce their consumption or use stored energy when grid capacity is strained.

 

Distributed energy resources are a consideration and even a concern for grid operators who fear the impact of losing customers. But, if utilities and customers are aligned, distributed energy resources can work to the advantage of both utilities and customers to:

 

    Regulate the flow of electricity.

    Transition to cleaner energy.

    Keep the grid safe and secure.

    Reduce energy costs.

 

Grid Changes: Moving to Multidirectional

 

Grid evolution is driving the need for cloud platforms because as the energy grid becomes more distributed and multidirectional, the enterprise platforms required to manage this flow of data and transactions must adapt.

 

In the past, power flowed one way, and the system was focused on safe, reliable, and affordable power. New and disruptive innovations, such as distributed energy resources, are changing this. Power now flows two ways. Energy can be mobile and the computing needs to manage everything are far greater. New digital energy cloud platforms, such as Salesforce, are filling that need.

Summary

 

In this unit, you learned about the various utility market models. You also learned about the challenges faced by utilities and the impact of industry transformation on business units and processes.

 

In the next unit, you learn about the common utility services and the key energy units of measure.

Learn Common Utility Processes, Services, and Units of Measure

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Explain the common utility service processes.

    Describe the common customer notifications.

    Describe the energy and utilities units of measure.

    Define the pricing and quoting terms for various energy and utility commodities.

 

Common Energy and Utilities Service Processes

 

Apart from delivering energy products to customers, utilities also provide additional services to make customers’ service experience better. Here are the most common energy and utilities service processes for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) customers.

 

Examples of energy and utility services provided to the customers.

Manage Communication Preferences and Services

 

With so many channels of communication available, good customer service tailors the communication method to customer preferences. Whether it’s incoming or outgoing communications, utilities must manage their customer communications efficiently so that customers get what they need in a way that’s convenient for them.

 

People and businesses move and change. Customer service agents communicate regularly with individuals who are moving to a different house and need their service changed. Agents also work with businesses that plan to move to a different location.

 

Customers who own multiple properties need to organize their utilities efficiently. Easy access to real-time information and customer service are important to property managers.

New Programs and Energy Services

 

New programs and energy services are exciting topics for many customers and a chance for companies to build relationships. They share information with customers about new programs, such as solar, electric vehicles, batteries, and related offers and rebates.

Bill Inquiry and Payment Assistance

 

Customers sometimes call to ask questions about their bill or to submit a meter reading, but this need not be the end of the conversation. With the right tools, customer service agents can use this time to build a relationship with the customer. This includes suggesting ways for the customer to save or manage energy, which can help them save money.

 

Customer service agents also reach out to customers about payments and sometimes about nonpayment of bills. This can lead to conversations about payment and collections assistance.

Service Outage, Safety, and Service Callout

 

Service outage and safety issue notifications are two-way communications. Customers can report a service outage or safety issue, and utilities can communicate a planned or unplanned service outage or safety issue to customers through several channels.

 

When an equipment malfunctions, companies dispatch workers to the site to make repairs. Service can be planned or unplanned, and utilities inform the customers about any potential outages and expected restoration times.

New Rates and Construction

 

Whether fixed or variable, rates change from time to time. New rates and rate changes are sometimes available by choice or mandate. Customer service agents regularly reach out to customers about changes and rate choices through calls and digital channels.

 

A lot goes on at new construction sites and not just for the general contractor. Utilities carry out many different actions at new construction sites, which they manage on a schedule to avoid disruptions in construction.

Common Customer Notifications

 

Now that you know the various common customer service tasks, it’s time to learn more about the common customer notifications.

 

Examples of the service notifications that customers expect from utilities.

Account Activation and Deactivation Services

 

Customers sometimes move in and out of a utility’s service area, and they occasionally switch to a competitor as well. With current trends, it’s more common than ever for customers to contact their utilities to add, switch, and deactivate service.

Welcome Communications

 

When a new customer joins a utility service, it’s important to start the customer relationship with a communication to welcome them onboard. Examples include welcome calls, gifts, and emails.

Electronic Fund Transfer Confirmations

 

With identity theft on the rise, many customers are setting up regular notifications through their banks. Offering customers the option to set up electronic funds transfer (EFT) confirmations with the utilities helps build customer trust.

Payment Reminders and Overdue Notices

 

With busy schedules, sometimes customers overlook or forget to pay their bills. They like reminders to help them avoid additional fees and hits to their credit scores.

Rate Change Notifications and Tariff Notices

 

While this type of notification is sometimes mandated, utility customers on variable rates run their businesses to maximize output and minimize costs. So, it’s important to know the rates at all times. Some rates vary in price by time of day or usage, and customers want to know when they cross a threshold into a higher rate or price.

Outage or Restoration Notifications

 

Regardless of whether you service individual customers or businesses, it’s important for everyone experiencing an outage to know when repairs are underway and when service is restored. Often, outage notices include an estimated time of restoration.

Crew Mobilization Notices

 

Whenever there’s a service disruption, it’s important to notify customers. Companies must also notify all crew members to mobilize and restore service. Mobilization notices alert crews when they must repair damage or perform services.

Customer Satisfaction Surveys

 

As with any type of customer, utility customers don’t always share when they’re unhappy. So, it’s important to reach out to customers occasionally, to determine their level of satisfaction and improvement areas.

Energy Product Measurements

 

Guess what utility companies do before selling their commodities? If you said measure and price their products, you get a gold star. Learn about some of the primary energy units of measure and pricing terms.

Electricity Units of Measure

 

An energy unit used for electrical power, particularly for utility bills, is the kilowatt-hour (kWh), with one kilowatt-hour equivalent to 3.6 megajoules. Electricity usage is measured in units of kilowatt-hours per year or another time period. This is a measurement of average power consumption, meaning the average rate at which energy is transferred. One kilowatt-hour per year is about 0.11 watts.

Natural Gas Units of Measure

 

Natural gas is often sold in units of energy content or by volume. The most commonly used units of measure for gas are gas cubic feet or meters. Ccf or one hundred cubic feet and Mcf or one thousand cubic feet are used to measure large volumes of natural gas.

Water, Wastewater, and Waste Units of Measure

 

Water and wastewater are measured in gallons, cubic feet or meters, or centum cubic feet (CCF). Waste charges can be measured by weight or volume in skips, bins, dumpsters, or other containers, depending on the content of the waste.

Energy and Utilities Pricing and Quoting Terms

 

Energy and utility companies employ usage pricing extensively. The four subtypes of pricing include unit rate, standing charge, interval pricing, and Flex pricing.

Summary

 

In this unit, you learned how utilities communicate with their customers and how customer expectations are changing rapidly. You got to know about some of the common notifications that utilities send to their customers. In the end, you also learned about the various energy units of measure and pricing terms.

 

In the next unit, you learn about the transformative shifts in the energy market and the impact of distributed energy resources and demand-side management.

Explore Market Pressures and Transformative Shifts

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Define the four Ds of energy transformation.

    Explain the factors driving digital transformation for energy and utility companies.

    Describe the impact of distributed energy resources and demand-side management on the energy market.

 

The Four Ds of Energy Transformation

 

Transformative shifts are taking place in the energy and utilities industries, including deregulation, decentralization, and distributed energy resources (DER). Moreover, decarbonization, digitalization, and demand-side management are intensifying the shift. Energy transformation is defined by four Ds: decarbonization, deregulation, digitalization, and decentralization. Here’s a closer look at each of these processes.

Decarbonization

 

The carbon dioxide formula with arrows pointing downward.

 

Decarbonization is the move to cleaner energy and conservation behavior. This move changes the technologies used to generate power, such as wind and solar. In turn, the changes impact the infrastructure of the business as well as the products available to customers. Types of products resulting from decarbonization include green energy and renewable-based products. As a result, these changes affect customer-facing sales and service opportunities.

Deregulation

Deregulated markets are moving away from verticalized utilities. Thanks to this shift, new market models are emerging in which nontraditional energy companies can now own the energy-customer relationship. As a result, traditional utility companies need new products and systems to support existing products and compete successfully. This means increased demands on their systems.

Digitalization

Digitalization includes using the cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data to build smarter, more responsive grids, with an additional focus on customer behavior. Customers are now used to the sophisticated digital services offered in other industries and expect the same from their utility companies. You learn more about digital transformation later in this unit.

Decentralization

 

A circle with arrows going outward and pointing to smaller circles.

 

With more on-site customer generation and distributed energy resources, such as solar power, EVs, microgrids, and battery storage, customers have more choice and power over the grid than ever. While this seems positive for customers, it places a new and increased burden on keeping a utility’s infrastructure safe, as the utility no longer owns, maintains, or physically controls all the energy resources that are now part of its energy grid.

What’s Driving Digital Transformation?

 

As the energy industry evolves, customer expectations and utility innovations become increasingly varied. Take a look at some of the questions utilities ask as they try to meet the demands of the new-age energy industry.

Customer Expectations and Value

 

As a utility company, how do I keep up? How do I personalize my products and communications for my vastly diverse customer base? How do I meet the customers where they want to be and anticipate their needs? How do I provide true value to my customers?

Digital-First, Work-from-Anywhere, Real-Time

 

How do I deliver a digital-first experience for my customers and employees, connecting them from anywhere? Can I be agile enough? Can I generate insights and enable actions in real time that are valuable to my customers and that support our business objectives?

Disruptive Regulatory and Technology Change

 

How will the industry landscape look in a competitive market, with new distributed, democratized, and decarbonized energy programs? How do I use IoT, smart devices, meters, and VPPs or networks to maximize grid, customer, and business value? What’s my place in new energy market models?

 

Salesforce solutions support all types of utility market models across the globe and are flexible enough to meet the different expectations and innovations of each market.

Impact of Distributed Energy Resources

 

DERs are electrical generation and storage facilities that consist of a variety of small, grid-connected, or distribution-system-connected devices. Distributed generation and storage enable the collection of energy from many sources, lower environmental impacts, and improve the security of supply.

 

A windmill, solar panel, and battery.

 

Conventional power stations, such as coal-fired and gas stations, nuclear-powered plants, hydroelectric dams, and large-scale solar power stations, are centralized and often transmit electric energy over long distances.

 

In contrast to conventional power stations, DER systems are decentralized, modular, and use flexible technologies that are located close to the load they serve. However, DERs have capacities of only 10 megawatts (MW) or less. Multiple generation and storage components can form these systems, which are sometimes referred to as hybrid power systems.

 

DER systems typically use renewable energy sources, such as hydro, biomass, biogas, sun, wind, and geothermal. DERs play an important role in the electric power distribution system as the energy industry moves towards renewable energy.

Grid-Connected Devices

 

A grid-connected device for electricity storage can also be classified as a DER system and is called a distributed energy storage system (DESS). DER systems can be managed and coordinated in a smart grid through an interface.

Microgrids

 

Microgrids are modern, localized, small-scale grids, as opposed to the traditional, centralized electricity grid or macrogrid. DERs can be the components of a microgrid. Think of a microgrid as a small, standalone grid, capable of meeting the energy needs of a defined area, such as a community or an area of several city blocks. To be self-sufficient in the provision of energy, a microgrid needs one or more sources of energy.

 

In the past, a microgrid has included resources such as a diesel generator, but with technological advances, resources now include DERs, such as solar or wind. On a larger scale, microgrids also add efficient batteries to the mix to store energy.

 

Microgrids can disconnect from the centralized grid and operate autonomously, strengthen grid resilience, and help mitigate grid disturbances. They’re typically low-voltage AC grids that use diesel generators and are installed by the community they serve. Microgrids nowadays employ a mixture of different DERs, such as solar hybrid power systems, which significantly reduce carbon emissions.

Impact of Demand-Side Management

 

Demand-side management (DSM) is a group of actions designed to efficiently manage a site’s energy consumption to cut the costs incurred for the supply of electrical energy. Costs arise from grid charges and general system charges, including taxes.

 

One way utilities can meet the demand on the grid is to reduce demand from the customer side by influencing customer consumption. The energy you save is measured in negawatts. No, it's not a joke. A negawatt is a hypothetical unit of power for measuring the amount of energy saved due to efficient energy consumption. A negawatt is the cheapest electron because it’s the one you don't use.

 

Utilities use conservation or energy-efficiency programs to help customers commit to using little or no energy during certain peak times, which allows the utility company to keep reserve power plants shut down. Without these programs, utilities often fire up reserve plants to meet customer demand. For instance, when all of the air conditioners switch on at the same time in a Los Angeles heat wave.

 

DSM optimization aims to achieve savings in electricity charges by modifying features of electricity consumption related to the:

 

    Overall consumption picture

    Consumption time profile

    Contractual supply parameters, including contractual power and grid connection parameters

 

As a result of the high penetration of renewable sources and the decentralization of production sources, grid managers in many countries now see increased instability on the grid and consequent disruptions to services.

Grid Services

 

Grid managers can use generation and consumption systems that offer grid services to limit the impact of service disruptions and ensure a balance between energy consumption and the amount of power fed into the grid. To engage in demand-side management, the first requirement is to carry out an in-depth analysis of onsite consumption. This involves assessing the unique requirements of each site and whether utilities can optimize the consumption habits of customers.

 

Whenever a change in habit is unfeasible or simply insufficient to achieve the desired cost reductions, utilities can evaluate these on-site installation elements.

 

    Battery energy storage systems (BESS)

    Renewable source systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines

    Cogeneration systems

Time to Get Fluent in AI

 

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a dream of many storytellers and sci-fi fans for years. But for a long time most people hadn’t given AI much serious thought because it was always something that might happen far into the future. Well, researchers and computer scientists haven’t been waiting for tomorrow to arrive, they’ve been working hard to make the dream of AI into a reality. In fact, some have said we’ve already entered the Age of AI.

In the foreground is a college student typing on computer, drawn in the style of fun 2D vector artwork.”]

 

It’s unclear just how deeply AI will become part of our daily lives. But what is certain is that for us to have meaningful conversations about AI, we need a shared vocabulary and a solid foundation of core concepts to build upon. As it stands, if you ask 10 people to define artificial intelligence, you’re likely to get 10 different answers. In this badge we try to reach an agreed-upon definition by exploring AI’s current capabilities. We also investigate how computer scientists create the AI systems that perform such incredible feats.

 

The Difficulty of Defining AI

 

The first step in defining AI is to recognize that our current notion of AI might be a little distorted. A steady diet of science fiction books and movies where AI is seen as a nefarious entity bent on conquering the world hasn’t helped.

 

Science fiction isn’t the only thing that’s complicated our view of AI. Generally speaking, we humans tend to think quite highly of ourselves; the benchmark by which everything else is measured. So when we speak of artificial intelligence, we can’t help but to compare it to our own intelligence. The problem is that humans aren’t the only intelligent beings out there. Animals, from crows to octopuses, use tools and problem solving to perform complex tasks. Even slime molds can solve mazes if given enough time.

 

And as we’ve begun to appreciate the huge spectrum of intelligence in the animal kingdom, we’ve also started to recognize the great diversity in our own human intelligence. Maybe you’ve met someone who’s fantastic at public speaking but can’t do math to save their life. Or someone who can always tell when you’re feeling a little anxious, but would trip over a soccer ball at the first opportunity. The point is that our intelligence is expressed in many, specialized forms. We need to think of artificial intelligence in the same way. There are specific kinds of AI that are good at specific kinds of tasks. So let’s bring some definition to what we mean by artificial intelligence by taking a close look at what AI can do today.

 

Main Types of AI Capabilities

 

Right now there’s no singular AI that’s good at everything. That idea, known as general AI, is still far into the future. Instead, over the years we’ve developed several specialized AI systems that are designed to perform specific tasks. The kinds of tasks they do generally fall into one of a few broader categories.

 

Numeric Predictions

 

Have you looked at a weather forecast recently? Predicting rain or shine helps you decide if you should grab an umbrella. Although we’ve made weather predictions for thousands of years, AI can do it better than any previous method.

 

A good prediction can help you answer all sorts of questions. Is this customer likely to renew their subscription? Are you at risk for a medical condition? Will there be high demand on the power grid this evening?

 

Often AI predictions take the form of a value between 0 (not going to happen) to 1 (totally going to happen). Numeric predictions include more than just percent values, they can predict any numeric value, such as dollars. Maybe your business wants to predict next quarter’s sales, or figure out the optimal pricing for your latest service: Widget+. And as a consumer you’re probably already affected by these kinds of numeric predictions, even more than you realize. Just imagine a trip overseas: the airline tickets, hotel room, ridesharing, and travelers insurance are all likely to be priced by AI to perfectly balance supply and demand.

The Trick Behind the Magic

 

What AI can do may seem like magic. And like magic, it’s natural to want a peek behind the curtain to see how it’s all done. What you’ll find is that computer scientists and researchers are using lots of data, math, and processing power in place of mirrors and misdirection. Learning how AI actually works will help you use it to its fullest potential, while avoiding pitfalls due to its limitations.

The Shift from Crafting to Training

 

For decades, programmers have written code that takes an input, processes it using a set of rules, and returns an output. For example, here’s how to find the average from a set of numbers.

 

    Input: 5, 8, 2, 9

    Process: Add the values [5 + 8 + 2 + 9] then divide by the number of inputs [4]

    Output: 6 

 

This simple set of rules for turning an input into an output is an example of an algorithm. Algorithms have been written to perform some pretty sophisticated tasks. But some tasks have so many rules (and exceptions) that it’s impossible to capture them all in a hand-crafted algorithm. Swimming is a good example of a task that is hard to encapsulate as a set of rules. You might get some advice before jumping in the pool, but you only really figure out what works once you’re trying to keep your head above water. Some things are learned best by experience.

 

What if we could train a computer in the same way? Not by tossing it into a pool, but by letting it figure out what works to succeed at a task? But just like learning to swim is very different from learning to speak a foreign language, the kind of training depends on the task. Let’s check out a few of the ways AI is trained.

Experience Required

 

Imagine that every time you went to the store to pick up milk, you tracked details of the trip in a spreadsheet. It’s a little weird, but go with it. You set up the following columns.

 

    Is it the weekend?

    Time of day

    Is it raining or not?

    Distance to store

    Total minutes of trip

 

After several trips you start getting a feel for how conditions affect how long it’ll take. Like, rain makes the drive longer, but it also means fewer people are shopping. Your brain makes connections between the inputs (weekend [W], time [T], raining [R], distance [D]) and the output (minutes [M]).

 

Diagram of inputs [W, T, R, D

 

But how can we get a computer to notice trends in the data so it can estimate too? One way is the guess-and-check method. Here’s how you do it.

 

Step 1: Assign all of your inputs a “weight.” This is a number that represents how strongly an input should affect the output. It’s OK to start with the same weight for everything.

 

Step 2: Use the weights with your existing data (and some clever math we won’t get into here) to estimate the minutes for a milk run. We can compare the estimate to the historic data. It’ll be way off, but that’s OK.

 

Step 3: Let the computer guess a new weight for each input, making some a little more important than others. For example, the time of day might be more important than whether or not it’s raining.

 

Step 4: Rerun the calculations to check if the new weights result in a better estimate. If so, it means the weights are a better fit, and changing in the right direction.

 

Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4, letting the computer tweak weights until its estimates aren’t getting any better.

 

At this point the computer has settled on weights for each input. If you think of weight as how strongly an input is connected to the output, you can make a diagram that uses line-thickness to represent the weight of a connection.

 

Diagram of input nodes connected to an output.

 

For this example it looks like the time of day has the strongest connection, but apparently rain doesn’t make much of a difference.

 

This process of guess-and-check has created a model of our milk runs. And like a model boat, we can take it to the pool to see if it floats, so to speak. That means testing it in the real world. So for your next several milk runs, before you leave, have the model estimate how long it’ll take. If it’s right enough times in a row, you can confidently let it do the estimating for every future trip.

 

A robot is at a workbench putting together the pieces of a small model sailboat. The picture is drawn in 2D vector art style.

 

[AI-generated image using DreamStudio at stability.ai with the prompt, “A robot is at a workbench putting together the pieces of a small model sailboat. The picture is drawn in 2D vector art style.”]

Use the Right Data for the Right Job

 

This is a very simple example of using training to make an AI model, but it touches on some important ideas. First, it’s an example of machine learning (ML), which is the process of using large amounts of data to train a model to make predictions, instead of handcrafting an algorithm.

 

Second, not all data is the same. In our milk run example, the spreadsheet is what we would call structured data. It is well organized, with labels on every column so you know the significance of every cell. In contrast, unstructured data would be something like a news article, or an unlabeled image file. The kind of data that you have available will affect what kind of training you can do.

 

Third, the structured data from our spreadsheet lets computers do supervised learning. It’s considered supervised because we can make sure every piece of input data has a matching, expected output that we can verify. Conversely, unstructured data is used for unsupervised learning, which is when AI tries to find connections in the data without really knowing what it’s looking for.

 

Letting the computer figure out a single weight for each input is just one kind of training regimen. But often interconnected systems are more complicated than what 1-to-1 weighting can represent. Thankfully, as you learn in the next unit, there are other ways to train!

The Need for Neural Networks

 

No conversation about AI is complete without mentioning neural networks. Neural networks are important tools for training AI models, so it’s good to have some idea of what they are. But before we get into the details, let’s first discuss why we need neural networks in the first place.

 

In the previous unit, you learned that we can train an AI model by letting it guess-and-check the importance-weight of each input. But the milk run example was actually overly simplified. Our model would give us pretty rough estimates. To understand why, let’s consider two scenarios.

 

    It’s raining on a Tuesday evening. You’d rather not get wet, so you (and many others like you) decide shopping can wait until tomorrow. In this scenario, rain is a significant factor.

    It’s raining on Saturday afternoon. For many people, this is the only time of week when they can go shopping. So the store will be busy, rain or shine. In this scenario, rain doesn’t make much difference.

 

The problem is that our original model can only assign one weight to rain, but we know it’s more complicated than that. There is a solution, though, and it starts by representing the two scenarios in two separate graphs. Again, line thickness shows importance. In the first, “weekend” and “time” are weak, while “rain” is strong. For the second, “weekend” is strong, while “time” and “rain” is weak.

 

Two diagrams, each connecting “weekend,” “time,” and “rain” to separate estimates. (gray, blue, yellow)

 

We know these two scenarios are significant because we’re smart and have experience buying milk. But a computer just starting to learn about milk runs doesn’t know anything yet! It has to consider many scenarios: weekend-evening-rain, weekday-morning-shine, and so forth. Instead of two graphs, eight might better represent the kinds of scenarios you encounter.

 

Eight very similar graphs, each have three nodes connected to one.

 

That’s a lot of very similar graphs. Since the three inputs always represent “weekend,” “time,” and “rain,” you can overlap them. If you move the outputs so they aren’t touching, you get a combined graph that looks like this.

 

A graph with three nodes on one side, and eight on the other. Every node is connected with a line.

 

The importance of each scenario depends on the specific inputs. But knowing the importance is only half the battle. Each scenario needs to affect the final estimate in its own way.

 

For example, the weekend-afternoon-shine milk run should take much longer. So let’s give it an adjustment of +5. When we do the math to calculate an estimate, it results in a larger number. While we’re at it, let’s give the weekday-morning-rain scenario an adjustment of -4 since we know milk runs are shortest at that time.

 

Each scenario gets its own adjustment, which is what we call a bias. In this case, bias is a good thing because it helps us get a more accurate estimate. Let’s redraw our graph to include the bias of each scenario.

 

A graph with three nodes on one side, and eight on the other, each with its own positive or negative number. Every node is connected with a line.

 

So what do we do with these eight scenarios and their biases? Using some more clever math, we can combine them into a final estimate. Some scenarios should contribute more than others, so you guessed it, we need more weights! We can update our graph to show how the scenarios connect to the final estimate with different strengths.

 

A graph with three nodes on the left side, eight in the middle, and one on the right. Lines connect left to middle, and middle to right.

 

This is our new model. More connections will hopefully mean better estimates. This web of connections, guided by weights and biases, is an example of a neural network. We call it that because the connections, forged by experience (data), resemble how the neurons in a brain are connected.

 

And while scenario is a good beginner word for describing a unique combination of factors, we should really use the word node for that concept. It’s what AI experts use, so moving forward we’ll use it too.

Adding Complexity to Neural Networks

 

Our new milk run model is a pretty basic example of a neural network. In practice, they can get quite complex. Let’s explore some of the ways researchers set up neural networks to get better results for specific tasks.

 

First, you might be wondering why we chose eight nodes to stand between our inputs and output. There’s actually some flexibility in that number. We know that having no nodes at all will give us rough estimates. In the same way, having too few might not capture all of the nuance of the system we’re trying to model. But having too many nodes is a problem, too. We don’t want to make the computer do more calculations than necessary. So there’s a sweet spot for the number of nodes where we get good results for the least effort. Choosing the right number is part of designing a good neural network.

 

There’s something else we can do to make artificial neural networks more like our own, organic ones. It has to do with how our minds often leap from idea to idea to find connections between two things that are not obviously related. Some of the most brilliant insights are the result of several leaps. So, what if we could make a neural network that could make more leaps, too? We can! We do it by adding more nodes as layers, connecting each node to its neighbor.

 

Diagram of a neural network with two layers of nodes between inputs and outputs.

 

Training AI by adding extra layers to find hidden meaning in data is what’s called deep learning. Thanks to an abundance of computing power, many neural networks are designed to have multiple layers. Again, the best number of layers is a balance between the number of calculations required and the quality of results they produce.

More Than Mental Math, It’s Neural Network Math

 

So, about those calculations. Up to this point we’ve glossed over the math part of training neural networks. That’s for a few reasons. First, the math can get really complicated, really fast. For example, here’s a snippet of a research paper about neural networks.

 

Screenshot of a highly technical research paper about neural networks

 

Yeah, it’s intense!

 

Second, the exact math is going to depend on what kind of task you’re training the neural network to do. Third, each new research paper updates the math as we learn what works better at training different models.

 

So, designing a neural network involves choosing the number of nodes, layers, and the appropriate math for the task it’s training for. With the model architecture ready, you have to let the computer use all that fancy math to do its guess-and-check routine. Eventually it’ll figure out the best weights and biases to give good estimates.

 

And this brings us to something that’s a little unsettling about artificial neural networks. Imagine a skilled talent scout who’s looking for the next great baseball player. “I’ll know him when I see him,” they might say. They can’t explain how they’ll know, they just will. In the same way, our neural network can’t explain why certain factors are important. Sure, we can look at the values attached to each weight and bias, but the relevance of a number that’s the result of a connection of a connection of a connection will be lost to us.

 

So just like how the mind of the talent scout is a black box, so is our neural network. Because we don’t observe the layers between the input and output, they’re referred to as hidden layers.

Wrap Up

 

To summarize, neural networks are a mix of nodes, layers, weights, biases, and a bunch of math. Together they mimic our own organic neural networks. Each neural network is carefully tuned for a specific task. Maybe it’s great at predicting rain, maybe it categorizes plants, or maybe it keeps your car centered in the lane on the highway. Whatever the task, neural networks are a big part of what makes AI seem magical. And now you know a little bit about how the trick is done.

Classifications

 

Is a hot dog a sandwich? This question has led to countless hours of friendly philosophical debate about how we categorize things. But in the real world, the stakes can be much higher. Is this plant edible or poisonous? Is that email legitimate or a phishing attempt? Classification is often the first step in taking some kind of action, making it an incredibly valuable skill.

 

So it isn’t surprising that computer scientists have worked hard to create AI that’s good at classifying data. Identifying plants and phishing emails is only the tip of the iceberg. Financial institutions need to flag fraudulent transactions. Medical professionals must diagnose illnesses. Social media platforms want to identify toxic comments. All of these are examples of classification problems. AI can effectively make the first pass at classifying, and then the professionals can take it from there.

 

Often, AI classifiers can do the job just as well, or better, than humans. That said, each classifier is only good at one, narrow task. So the AI that’s great at detecting phishing emails would be lousy at identifying pictures of actual fish.

 

Robotic Navigation

 

Some AIs excel at navigating a changing environment, and that might mean actual navigation in the case of autonomous (hands-free) driving. AI-powered cars are already quite capable of keeping centered in a lane and following at a safe distance on the highway. They adapt to curves in the road, gusts of wind from semi trucks, and sudden stops due to traffic.

 

AI that can adapt to changing environmental conditions have all sorts of real-world applications. For example, businesses need to produce and deliver products to their customers every day. Lots of market conditions play a role in how quickly that gets done: materials availability, manufacturing capacity, existing inventory, transportation costs, even real-time traffic. AI can optimize the supply chain even while conditions are changing.

 

And let’s not forget robots! Even the modest robot floor sweeper can avoid stairs and chairs. On a bigger scale, assembly lines are being fitted with robots that become faster and more efficient over time. Those same robots can adjust for changes to the production method without costly reprogramming. And researchers are creating rescue robots that can traverse disaster areas, such as a collapsed building. A robot-caterpillar that can squeeze through tiny cracks could deliver aid and hope to those trapped inside.

 

Language Processing

 

On November 30, 2022, Merriam-Webster’s word of the day was quiddity. Those who learned that word got a little better at what might be the most important skill of all: communication. On that same day, the world was introduced to ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence that demonstrated its own communication skills. It could write long responses to questions about almost any topic. And the responses seemed like they were written by a human. ChatGPT is one of the most capable AIs built to interpret everyday language and act on it in some meaningful way. This is known in the industry as natural language processing, or just NLP.

 

Natural language processing relies on an understanding of how words are used together, and that lets AI extract the intention behind the words. For example, you might want to translate a document from English to German. Or maybe you want a short summary of a long, scientific paper. AI can do that too.

 

NLP is a huge part of generative AI, a subcategory of AI that takes words and turns them into unique images, sounds, and of course other words. Generative AI is such a disruptive technology that we’ve devoted a whole badge to Generative AI Basics. Check it out when you’re done here.

 

In Summary

 

Artificial intelligence can be thought of as the ability for a computer to perform skills typically associated with human intuition, inference, and reasoning. At this time, AI skills are very specialized, and fall into some broad categories like numeric predictions and language processing.

 

Now that you have a sense of what AI is (and isn’t), you’re ready to explore how computer scientists and researchers create AI.

What’s Automation for Service?

 

Customer service is about providing a smooth and simple journey that meets each customer’s needs. It often takes many steps, agents, and systems to complete that journey. Automation helps to streamline the process.

 

For example, what if you could automate a repetitive task, like entering customer details only once and having them show up wherever they’re needed across the company? This process saves time for the customer and service team while ensuring accuracy. Likewise, automating complex processes across your entire business ensures that your team has the tools they need when customers are sent to the next stage in their journey.

 

Here’s a quick video overview of the service experience. While you watch it, think about how this service journey is automated and ways you could adapt it to your business.

Before You Start

 

This badge contains terms like neural networks and deep learning that are described in detail in the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals and Generative AI Basics badges. We recommend that you earn those badges first.

What Is Natural Language Processing?

 

Natural language processing (NLP), is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that combines computer science and linguistics to give computers the ability to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that’s meaningful and useful to humans.

 

NLP helps computers perform useful tasks like understanding the meaning of sentences, recognizing important details in text, translating languages, answering questions, summarizing text, and generating responses that resemble human responses.

 

NLP is already so commonplace in our everyday lives that we usually don’t even think about it when we interact with it or when it does something for us. For example, maybe your email or document creation app automatically suggests a word or phrase you could use next. You may ask a virtual assistant, like Siri, to remind you to water your plants on Tuesdays. Or you might ask Alexa to tell you details about the last big earthquake in Chile for your daughter’s science project.

 

The chatbots you engage with when you contact a company’s customer service use NLP, and so does the translation app you use to help you order a meal in a different country. Spam detection, your online news preferences, and so much more rely on NLP.

A Very Brief History of NLP

 

It’s worth mentioning that NLP is not new. In fact, its roots wind back to the 1950s when researchers began using computers to understand and generate human language. One of the first notable contributions to NLP was the Turing Test. Developed by Alan Turing, this test measures a machine’s ability to answer any question in a way that’s indistinguishable from a human. Shortly after that, the first machine translation systems were developed. These were sentence- and phrase-based language translation experiments that didn’t progress very far because they relied on very specific patterns of language, like predefined phrases or sentences.

 

A 1950s mainframe-style computer being operated by a computer scientist.

 

By the 1960s, researchers were experimenting with rule-based systems that allowed users to ask the computer to complete tasks or have conversations.

 

The 1970s and 80s saw more sophisticated knowledge-based approaches using linguistic rules, rule-based reasoning, and domain knowledge for tasks like executing commands and diagnosing medical conditions.

 

Statistical approaches (i.e., learning from data) to NLP were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, leading to advances in speech recognition, machine translation, and machine algorithms. During this period, the introduction of the World Wide Web in 1993 made vast amounts of text-based data readily available for NLP research.

Since about 2009, neural networks and deep learning have dominated NLP research and development. NLP areas of translation and natural language generation, including the recently introduced ChatGPT, have vastly improved and continue to evolve rapidly.

Human Language Is “Natural” Language

 

What is natural language anyway? Natural language refers to the way humans communicate with each other using words and sentences. It’s the language we use in conversations, when we read, write, or listen. Natural language is the way we convey information, express ideas, ask questions, tell stories, and engage with each other. While NLP models are being developed for many different human languages, this module focuses on NLP in the English language.

 

If you completed the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals badge, you learned about unstructured data and structured data. These are important terms in NLP, too. Natural language–the way we actually speak–is unstructured data, meaning that while we humans can usually derive meaning from it, it doesn’t provide a computer with the right kind of detail to make sense of it. The following paragraph about an adoptable shelter dog is an example of unstructured data.

 

Tala is a 5-year-old spayed, 65-pound female husky who loves to play in the park and take long hikes. She is very gentle with young children and is great with cats. This blue-eyed sweetheart has a long gray and white coat that will need regular brushing. You can schedule a time to meet Tala by calling the Troutdale shelter.

 

For a computer to understand what we mean, this information needs to be well-defined and organized, similar to what you might find in a spreadsheet or a database. This is called structured data. The information included in structured data and how the data is formatted is ultimately determined by algorithms used by the desired end application. For example, data for a translation app is structured differently than data for a chatbot. Here’s how the data in the paragraph above might look as structured data for an app that can help match dogs with potential adopters.

 

    Name: Tala

    Age: 5

    Spayed or Neutered: Spayed

    Sex: Female

    Breed: Husky

    Weight: 65 lbs.

    Color: Gray and white

    Eye color: Blue

    Good with children: Yes

    Good with cats: Yes

    Favorite activities: Parks, hikes

    Location: Troutdale

 

Natural Language Understanding and Natural Language Generation

 

Today’s NLP matured with its two subfields, natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG). Data processed from unstructured to structured is called natural language understanding (NLU). NLU uses many techniques to interpret written or spoken language to understand the meaning and context behind it. You learn about these techniques in the next unit.

 

Data processed the reverse way–from structured to unstructured–is called natural language generation (NLG). NLG is what enables computers to generate human-like language. NLG involves the development of algorithms and models that convert structured data or information into meaningful, contextually appropriate, natural-like text or speech. It also includes the generation of code in a programming language, such as generating a Python function for sorting strings.

 

In the past, NLU and NLG tasks made use of explicit linguistic structured representations like parse trees. While NLU and NLG are still critical to NLP today, most of the apps, tools, and virtual assistants we communicate with have evolved to use deep learning or neural networks to perform tasks from end-to-end. For instance, a neural machine translation system may translate a sentence from, say, Chinese, directly into English without explicitly creating any kind of intermediate structure. Neural networks recognize patterns, words, and phrases to make language processing exponentially faster and more contextually accurate.

 

In the next unit, you learn more about our natural language methods and techniques that enable computers to make sense of what we say and respond accordingly.

Learn About Natural Language Parsing

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Discuss the basic elements of natural language.

    Describe several important techniques used when parsing natural language.

    Explain how sentiment, intent, and context analysis contribute to NLP.

 

Basic Elements of Natural Language

 

Understanding and processing natural language is a fundamental challenge for computers. That's because it involves not only recognizing individual words, but also comprehending their relationships, their context, and their meaning.

 

Our natural language, in text and speech, is characterized by endless complexity, nuances, ambiguity, and mistakes. In our everyday communication, we encounter words with several meanings; words that sound the same but are spelled differently and have different meanings; misplaced modifiers; misspellings; and mispronunciations. We also encounter people who speak fast, mumble, or who take forever to get to the point; and people who use speech patterns in accents or dialects that are different from ours.

 

Take this sentence for example:

 

“We saw six bison on vacation in Yellowstone National Park.”

 

You might giggle a little as you imagine six bison in hats and sunglasses posing for selfies in front of Old Faithful. But, most likely, you understand what actually happened–that is, that someone who was on vacation in Yellowstone National Park saw six bison.

 

Or this:

 

“They swam out to the buoy.”

 

If you heard someone speak this sentence without any context, you may think the people involved swam out to a male child, when in fact, they swam out to a marker in the water. The pronunciation of “boy” and “buoy” is slightly different, but the enunciation is not always made clear.

 

While humans are able to flex and adapt to language fairly easily, training a computer to consider these kinds of nuances is quite difficult.

 

Elements of natural language in English include:

 

    Vocabulary: The words we use

    Grammar: The rules governing sentence structure

    Syntax: How words are combined to form sentences according to grammar

    Semantics: The meaning of words, phrases, and sentences

    Pragmatics: The context and intent behind cultural or geographic language use

    Discourse and dialogue: Units larger than a single phrase or sentence, including documents and conversations

    Phonetics and phonology: The sounds we make when we communicate

    Morphology: How parts of words can be combined or uncombined to make new words

 

Parsing Natural Language

 

Teaching a computer to read and derive meaning from words is a bit like teaching a child to read–they both learn to recognize words, their sounds, meaning, and pronunciation. But when a child learns to read, they usually have the advantage of context from a story; visual cues from illustrations; and relationships to things they already know, like trees or animals. They also often get assistance and encouragement from experienced readers, who help explain what they’re learning. These cues help new readers identify and attach meaning to words and phrases that they can generalize to other things they read in the future.

We know that computers are a different kind of smart, so while a computer needs to understand the elements of natural language described above, the approach needs to be much more scientific. NLP uses algorithms and methods like large language models (LLMs), statistical models, machine learning, deep learning, and rule-based systems to process and analyze text. These techniques, called parsing, involve breaking down text or speech into smaller parts to classify them for NLP. Parsing includes syntactic parsing, where elements of natural language are analyzed to identify the underlying grammatical structure, and semantic parsing which derives meaning.

 

As mentioned in the last unit, natural language is parsed in different ways to match intended outcomes. For example, natural language that’s parsed for a translation app uses different algorithms or models and is parsed differently than natural language intended for a virtual assistant like Alexa.

 

Syntactic parsing may include:

 

    Segmentation: Larger texts are divided into smaller, meaningful chunks. Segmentation usually occurs at the end of sentences at punctuation marks to help organize text for further analysis.

    Tokenization: Sentences are split into individual words, called tokens. In the English language, tokenization is a fairly straightforward task because words are usually broken up by spaces. In languages like Thai or Chinese, tokenization is much more complicated and relies heavily on an understanding of vocabulary and morphology to accurately tokenize language.

    Stemming: Words are reduced to their root form, or stem. For example breaking, breaks, or unbreakable are all reduced to break. Stemming helps to reduce the variations of word forms, but, depending on context, it may not lead to the most accurate stem. Look at these two examples that use stemming:

 

“I’m going outside to rake leaves.”

 

Stem = leave

 

“He always leaves the key in the lock.”

 

Stem = leave

 

    Lemmatization: Similar to stemming, lemmatization reduces words to their root, but takes the part of speech into account to arrive at a much more valid root word, or lemma. Here are the same two examples using lemmatization:

 

“I’m going outside to rake leaves.”

 

Lemma = leaf

 

“He always leaves the key in the lock.”

 

Lemma = leave

 

    Part of speech tagging: Assigns grammatical labels or tags to each word based on its part of speech, such as a noun, adjective, verb, and so on. Part of speech tagging is an important function in NLP because it helps computers understand the syntax of a sentence.

    Named entity recognition (NER): Uses algorithms to identify and classify named entities–like people, dates, places, organizations, and so on–in text to help with tasks like answering questions and information extraction.

 

Semantic Analysis

 

Parsing natural language using some or all of the steps we just described does a pretty good job of capturing the meaning of text or speech. But it lacks soft skill nuances that make human language, well, human. Semantic parsing involves analyzing the grammatical format of sentences and relationships between words and phrases to find the meaning representation. Extracting how people feel, why they are engaging, and details about circumstances surrounding an interaction all play a crucial role in accurately deciphering text or speech and forming an appropriate response.

 

Here are several common analysis techniques that are used in NLP. Each of these techniques can be powered by a number of different algorithms to get the desired level of understanding depending on the specific task and the complexity of the analysis.

 

Sentiment analysis: Involves determining whether a piece of text (such as a sentence, a social media post, a review, or a tweet) expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. A sentiment is a feeling or an attitude toward something. For example, sentiment analysis can determine if this customer review of a service is positive or negative: "I had to wait a very long time for my haircut.” Sentiment helps identify and classify emotions or opinions in text to help businesses understand how people feel about their products, services, or experiences.

 

A happy-looking woman with a speech bubble that says, “This is my favorite pizza, ever!” and a grumpy-looking man with a speech bubble that says, “I’m still waiting for my haircut.”

 

Intent analysis: Intent helps us understand what someone wants or means based on what they say or write. It’s like deciphering the purpose or intention behind their words. For example, if someone types, “I can’t log in to my account,” into a customer support chatbot, intent analysis would recognize that the person’s intent is to get help to access their account. The chatbot might reply with details about resetting a password or other means the user can try to access their account. Virtual assistants, customer support systems, or chatbots often use intent analysis to understand user requests and provide appropriate responses or actions.

 

Context (discourse) analysis: Natural language relies heavily on context. The interpretation of a statement might change based on the situation, the details provided, and any shared understanding that exists between the people communicating. Context analysis involves understanding this surrounding information to make sense of a piece of text. For example, if someone says, “They had a ball,” context analysis can determine if they are talking about a fancy dance party, a piece of sports equipment, or a whole lot of fun. It does this by considering the previous conversation or the topic being discussed. Context analysis helps NLP systems interpret words more accurately by taking into account the broader context, the relationships between words, and other relevant information.

 

These three analysis techniques–sentiment analysis, intent analysis, and context analysis–play important roles in extracting valuable insights from text and speech data. They create a more sophisticated and accurate understanding and engagement with textual content in various applications of NLP.

Summary

 

In this module, you’ve learned about NLP at a very high level, and as it relates to the English language. To-date, the majority of NLP study is conducted using English, but you can also find a great deal of research done in Spanish, French, Farsi, Urdu, Chinese, and Arabic. NLP is a very rapidly evolving field of AI. And advancements in NLP are quickly leading to more sophisticated language understanding, cross-language capabilities, and integration with other AI fields.

Explore Machine Learning Predictions

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Understand what machine learning can do for your CRM data.

    Identify ways to use machine learning predictions.

 

Unlock the Power of Your Data

 

Today, trillions of gigabytes of data exist. And as a company in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), the data you possess can predict future outcomes and drive decision-making. But according to the Salesforce Untapped Data Research, most companies aren’t harnessing the power of their data’s potential even though four out of five (80%) business leaders say data is critical to decision-making.

 

Using a type of AI called machine learning (ML), you can transform historical data into predictive insights. This is known as predictive AI, which is different from generative AI.

 

    Predictive AI informs, using existing data to discover something new about the data. For example, predictive AI estimates the likelihood of attrition or fraud.

    Generative AI assists, using existing data to create new data similar to what already exists. For example, generative AI creates new text and images.

 

To learn more about predictive vs generative AI, check out the Discover AI Techniques and Applications unit in Data Fundamentals for AI.

Inject Machine Learning into Your Business

 

Predictive insights from machine learning enable business users to make better decisions, faster. Use predictive AI from machine learning to drive innovation, efficiency, and strategic decision-making across your organization. Here are some of the top use cases for predictive insights (but there are plenty more).

Benefit from Machine Learning, No Data Science Experience Required

 

You don’t need to be a data scientist to leverage machine learning. While data scientists are often involved in training and refining ML models, the insights from the model are meant for the business users. According to the Harvard Business Review, data scientists struggle to communicate the value of ML insights and cite “results not used by decision makers” as one of the top challenges.

 

Adding ML to Salesforce bridges the gap between data scientists and the business. In Salesforce, users can make decisions and take actions on the ML insights, without having to read a data science report.

 

You can transform historical data into meaningful insights for your organization using Einstein.

 

    Einstein Studio: Use the ML-powered insights in Data Cloud with Connected Models data science teams already built by connecting to it and bringing the model’s insights into Salesforce. You can leave the model where it is (like AWS SageMaker), and leverage its ML-powered insights within Salesforce.

    Einstein Discovery: Build your own ML model from the ground up in CRM Analytics, with Einstein’s guidance. Rely on Einstein to walk you through building, training, evaluating, and activating an ML model in Data Cloud.

 

Now you understand what machine learning can do for your data, and can identify ways your organization can benefit from ML-powered predictions.

Get Started with the Analytics 360 Integration for Sales Cloud

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Explain what Google Analytics 360 is.

    Outline the values of the integration with Salesforce Sales Cloud.

    List the integration requirements to get started.

 

Note

 

This module was produced in collaboration with Google, which owns, supports, and maintains the Google products, services, and features described here. Use of Google products, services, and features is governed by privacy policies and service agreements maintained by Google.

 

Note

 

Universal Analytics 360 and the data sources it uses, universal properties (UA), are being sunset. Trailhead shall maintain these modules to support Trailblazers who continue to use these services until such time. We are hard at work developing content that supports the new Google Analytics 4 (GA4) integration.

Online and Offline, Sales and Marketing, Connecting the Dots

 

With customer touch points occurring across so many sources, it can be hard for marketing and sales teams to create a complete, accurate view of the customer story. It’s even harder when a large portion of the sales process occurs offline. Like chapters in a book, you need to have them all together for everything to make sense.

 

When you have a complete view of the customer, you can understand how effective your marketing has been in delivering sales. You can improve the performance of your digital marketing by optimizing your bids or by focusing on the most valuable audiences. Sales teams can get even more targeted and relevant support to help them progress and close deals.

 

The sales funnel has a combination of online interactions, such as site browsing, and offline interactions, such as marketing and sales qualification.

What is Google Marketing Platform and what is Analytics 360?

 

Google Marketing Platform is a unified advertising and analytics platform that helps enterprise marketers make better decisions faster. With Google Marketing Platform, you’re in control of your marketing, so you have the flexibility to adapt to the needs of your business and your customers.

 

Google Analytics 360*, part of Google Marketing Platform, gives you the tools you need to better understand your customers. Use the insights you learn to take action, such as improving your website, creating tailored audience lists, and more. In addition to the features available in Google Analytics, Analytics 360 provides additional capabilities:

 

    Advanced Analysis

    Unsampled reports

    Google BigQuery export

    Data-driven attribution

    Native integrations with Google Marketing Platform

    Integrations with Salesforce

 

*There is an annual license fee for Analytics 360 and Salesforce is an authorized reseller.

How Salesforce and Google Put It All Together

 

With the Sales Cloud and Google Analytics 360 integration, you can link your accounts and import your Sales Cloud data directly into Analytics 360 and get a more complete view of the entire customer story, whether it happens online, offline, or both. This will help you better optimize your digital marketing and bring more customers to your sales teams.

 

This integration is designed to save time, get more valuable insights, help you optimize your media, and customize your marketing experiences for specific audiences.

 

Save Time. Combining all of these offline and online insights used to be a time-consuming process involving multiple spreadsheets and disparate data. This integration helps you cut down on the wait time from importing offline conversion data and helps you stitch together these insights automatically, updating as often as hourly.

 

Get More Insights. With Sales Cloud data in Analytics 360, you can see offline sales data alongside your site analytics and media data. For example, is organic search driving more phone sales compared to paid search? With your offline sales data from Salesforce Sales Cloud in Analytics 360, you now have the insights to help you answer this question, and many more.

 

Optimized Media for Better ROI. Optimize paid media based on offline sales activity. For example, once you’ve created Goals in Analytics 360 based on your Sales Cloud events, you can automatically optimize your search or display campaigns for actual sales that occur offline, instead of optimizing for form submissions on your site. This will likely lead to improved ROI as you spend your digital media budgets on more valuable outcomes.

 

Intelligently Build Audiences. With Sales Cloud data in Analytics 360, you will be able to more intelligently build audiences based on the intersection of online and offline data. For instance, you can create audiences in Analytics 360 made up of qualified leads from Sales Cloud. You can then reach those customers with more relevant ads, including search ads, display ads, and video ads.

Two Things You Need to Know

 

There are two key requirements you should keep in mind if you are interested in using this integration.

 

    You must be a licensee of both Salesforce Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 in order to use this integration. This integration is only available to customers who have purchased Analytics 360.

    The integration supports sharing data from Sales Cloud Objects Leads and Opportunities. The Leads and Opportunities shared with Analytics 360 must have originated from an Analytics 360-tagged site for the integration to work, and the lead can be created either via an online lead form (native integration) or via a phone call (custom solution adding a call tracking solution).

 

Note

 

If your organization uses Custom Objects, you may have to use an alternative setup depending on how those Custom Objects are deployed. Please refer to Unit 3: Dive Into Some Use Cases and Examples and corresponding resources, or consult with your service provider for more details.

Learn Setup and Administration

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Identify the key roles involved in integrating Sales Cloud and Analytics 360.

    List the technical and administrative steps needed to complete the integration.

 

In this unit, we review the technical steps required to integrate Sales Cloud and Analytics 360. The good news is that linking your Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 accounts is easy!

What’s Required?

 

You will need login and administrative access to both Analytics 360 and Sales Cloud, as you’ll need to both configure Sales Cloud to collect certain data and then Analytics 360 to map to and receive that data.

 

Three people standing in a meeting room discussing integration.

Key Roles

 

While stakeholders may vary depending on company size and organization, there are typically 3 key roles needed to ensure a successful integration of Sales Cloud and Analytics 360:

 

    Analytics Lead and/or Admin. An Analytics 360 Administrator is necessary to create a new data import from Sales Cloud and set up the new events within Analytics 360. This requires proper credentials within Analytics 360.

    CRM Lead and/or Admin. A Salesforce Administrator will need to set up the link with Analytics 360 and create the fields in Sales Cloud to store key data—Analytics Client ID (GACLID) and Google Analytics Tracking ID—in the Lead and Opportunity objects.

    Web Development Lead. A web developer is necessary to modify the lead collection form on your website and add the GACLID to the parameters passed to Sales Cloud upon lead submission.

 

The size and complexity of your implementation will influence who is on the integration team. How your company is organized will also influence who is on the integration team. When you are organizing your team and considering who your stakeholders are, keep in mind, one of the main goals is to allow the marketing team and the sales team to work better together.

Permissions

 

The user performing the linking must be an Admin (have Edit permissions) for the Analytics 360 implementation. The Analytics 360 Sales Cloud Data Import requires access to several Salesforce fields, organized by object. A Sales Cloud user with System Administrator access likely has access to all necessary fields.

Create Custom Fields in Sales Cloud

 

Create three new custom fields where you will store the Google Analytics IDs in Sales Cloud. You can name these fields however you’d like. The names below provide examples. Once created, you select and map these fields at the Data Import configuration setup stage.

 

    Client ID: one with the Field Name, e.g., GACLIENTID

    User ID: (optional) another with the Field Name, e.g., GAUSERID

    Tracking ID: another one with the Field Name, e.g., GATRACKID

 

These custom fields need to be created on both Lead and Opportunity objects and mapped between the 2 objects so that once a lead is converted into an opportunity, these fields are copied over. Also, you should ensure that status and stages have history tracking on.

Adjust Your Lead Form

 

Adjust your lead form to pass the required information into Sales Cloud.

 

    Add ClientID as well as User ID (optional) into your lead form as new hidden input field(s).

    Add Tracking ID in your lead form as a new hidden input field with the value matching the Tracking ID for your site.

 

Link Analytics 360 to Your Sales Cloud Account

 

In this step, you'll link Analytics to your Salesforce Sales Cloud account by creating a new Data Import data set, and then by authorizing access to your Sales Cloud account.

 

    First, log in to your Google Analytics 360 account and navigate to Admin > Property, then click Data Import to Create a new Data Import Schema.

    Select the Salesforce type under CRM Data to import data about offline conversions from Sales Cloud.

    Name and save your Data Set. For example, Salesforce Offline Conversions.

    Create a new Sales Cloud authorization by naming the Credentials set to reuse later (for example, GA-SC) and click Access Salesforce.com to log in to your Sales Cloud account in the pop-up and complete the linking. The pop-up will automatically close upon successful login authentication and the linking will be completed.

 

The Create Data Set screen with CRM Data section and the Continue button highlighted by a red box.

Select the Milestones to Import

 

In this step, you'll select the Salesforce lead and opportunity milestones to import. You'll also choose how often to import them.

 

    Select the Lead and/or Opportunity milestone(s) that you want to import as Events from your Sales Cloud account to Analytics 360. For example:

        Lead: Contacted

        Lead: Qualified

        Opportunity: Open / Proposal

        Opportunity: Closed / Won

        Opportunity: Closed / Lost

    You also have the option to import attribute and product data. Attribute data import allows you to import user attributes from custom fields and selected standard fields from your Salesforce Lead and Opportunity objects. This includes:

        Industry

        NumberOfEmployees

        Rating

        ScoreIntelligenceId

 

This step is highly recommended, as these attributes enable a wide variety of new audience targeting and analysis use cases.

Set Import Frequency and Verify Setup

 

You’re almost there! In this final step, you’ll first have the opportunity to define the frequency of data import—hourly is recommended.

 

    In the Analytics 360 UI, navigate to Admin > Property > Data Import and click Manage Uploads.

    In the Uploads for Salesforce Offline Conversions page, click More, then Fetch Now. This will attempt to upload your Sales Cloud data to Analytics. If the upload is successful, the Status column will show Completed. If an error occurs, the Status column shows Failed with a link to display more details.

Dive Into Some Use Cases and Examples

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Describe several use cases for the Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 integration.

    Understand how data from Sales Cloud and Google Marketing Platform in Google Cloud can be used for advanced marketers.

 

Now that you’ve learned the basics about the Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 integration, let’s dive deeper into use cases and examples of how our platforms can work together to empower your sales and marketing teams to work better together.

Visualize the Full Sales Funnel from Online to Offline

 

Use Online Events from Analytics 360 and Offline Events Imported from Sales Cloud

 

One of the simplest but most effective ways to get value from this integration is to explore your offline Sales Cloud data directly in Analytics 360.

 

    First, ensure that you are tracking the relevant steps of the online funnel with events. For example, if you want to look at the funnel of users who visited your product page then submitted a lead and finally converted, you should set up an event in Analytics 360 for when a user visits your product page.

    From there, create a custom report that looks at each of those events, the online events measured by Analytics 360 (e.g., the product page visit and the lead form submission) and the offline events imported from Sales Cloud (e.g., lead and opportunity milestones). Then analyze your full online to offline funnel to understand the performance of your different marketing channels.

 

Use Custom Funnels and Build Targeted Audiences

 

Using the Custom Funnels feature in Analytics 360, you can visualize the steps your users are taking to complete a purchase on your website and take action where there is drop off. Now with your Sales Cloud data integrated into Analytics 360, you can use Custom Funnels to see how successful your business is at turning online leads measured in Analytics 360 into offline sales measured in Sales Cloud.

 

Imagine you are a solar panel company, and your website has a lead form potential customers can use to get in touch with a member of your sales team. Now, you can use Custom Funnels to visualize what percentage of leads submitted online were converted to in-person consult, and then which of those went on to purchase the solar panels. These visual reports help you identify drop-off points so that you can fine-tune the customer experience and improve marketing performance.

 

The Solar Panel Sales Performance dashboard in Google Analytics 360 showing 101 qualified sales opportunities and a call to action based on the data.

 

    To take immediate action from Custom Funnels, you can simply click Create new segment to build an audience of people who have dropped off from a particular stage. Once you have that audience segment built, you can use it for media targeting, site personalization, or qualitative research. For example, you could build a segment of customers who have filled out the online lead form but have not scheduled a call with a sales agent. You could use digital ads or custom site messaging to encourage this group to follow up. You learn more about this in the sections below.

    Then, with advanced attribution tools in Analytics 360, such as Data-driven Attribution, you can create more accurate cross-channel attribution models so you can better understand what channels drive offline sales. For example, after you apply a data-driven statistical model, you may uncover that paid search and email drives more offline solar panel installations than social. You can use this information to adjust your investment for paid search and email—improving your return on ad spend (ROAS) in the process.

 

Optimize Your Marketing Investment to Offline Goals

 

Going one step further, you can also create Goals in Analytics 360 based on your Sales Cloud events and optimize your digital marketing campaigns for sales that occur offline, instead of just optimizing for form submissions on your site.

 

How? Simply share these goals (triggered by offline events imported from Sales Cloud) to Google Ads and Search Ads 360, then adapt your search bidding strategy to account for these goals.

 

Note

 

For the solar company optimizing media for installations scheduled over the phone, this could mean paying more for keywords that drive those successful phone calls, and paying less for keywords which drive unqualified leads that do not convert to consultations or to eventual sales.

Intelligently Build Audiences with Sales Cloud Data

 

In addition to more insightful reporting and smarter media optimization from offline data, the connection between Analytics 360 and Sales Cloud gives you even more audience attributes to work with, helping you improve the specificity of your audiences.

 

For example, if you’re an insurance company that generates leads online but sells policies in person via an agent, you could build an audience in Analytics 360 of all customers who have purchased an auto insurance policy offline. You could use that audience to either deliver relevant display ads (like new insurance products shown to those who browsed that page online) using Display & Video 360, or customize your website (like a customer service showcase) using Optimize 360.

 

Note

 

Optimize 360, part of Google Marketing Platform, allows you to create different variations of your website and deliver a personalized experience that works for each customer. Powered by the native integration with Analytics 360, you can use Optimize 360 to conduct site testing and personalization on the insights you’ve gained from the Analytics 360 and Sales Cloud integration.

You can even use Einstein Lead Scoring to build these audiences in the above use cases. For example, the solar company could build an Analytics 360 audience of users who filled out a lead form online and then were assigned an Einstein Lead Score of 80 or higher. Then, they can share that audience with Optimize 360 to ensure those qualified users have a unique site experience or to Display & Video 360 to deliver more relevant ads to keep them engaged.

Learn How You Can Delight Your Customers Even More

 

Once you have built valuable audiences using Sales Cloud and Analytics 360, there are even more opportunities to learn about them and help you discover new, similar customers.

 

    Similar Audiences. Similar Audiences is a powerful—but simple—way to reach a much larger audience and drive sales by algorithmically expanding the reach of your existing audiences. For example, you can import into Analytics 360 an audience of highly qualified leads from Sales Cloud, then send that list to Display & Video 360 to build a similar audience that looks like your prospects. You can show tailored ads to this list to try to grow new business.

    Surveys. Google Surveys 360 gives you the ability to ask questions directly to your audiences, allowing you to learn more qualitative information from your users after you’ve engaged with them. For instance, you could ask your customers how they feel about your brand or your category, helping you to learn valuable and first-hand insights.

    Google Cloud for deeper analysis. The integration between Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 also allows users to take advantage of Google Cloud. All your Analytics 360 data, including your imported Sales Cloud data, can be sent directly to Google Cloud’s BigQuery—a fast, highly scalable, cost-effective, and fully managed cloud data warehouse for analytics, with built-in machine learning. Learn more.

 

As you can see, by using the full capabilities of Salesforce Sales Cloud, Analytics 360 and Google Marketing Platform, you can deliver exceptional experiences for your customers and grow your business.

Assess Yourself

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    List the steps for creating a career plan.

    Identify your unique strengths, skills, and talents and what’s important to you.

    Describe the different elements of self-assessment.

 

A Quick Introduction to Career Development

 

Whether you’re just starting out in your career or already have a few years of experience under your belt, it can be helpful to step back and think about your career plan. Career planning is not a one-time event; it’s an ongoing process to revisit throughout your career as your priorities and interests shift and change.

 

Career development is like a jungle gym.

 

Picture career development as a jungle gym to explore, not a ladder to climb. There are various directions you can explore: up, down, and sideways. When you’re clear about your career goals, you can choose the options that are the best fit. Then it’s time to get ready for new experiences or new roles.

 

The career development process can be helpful to revisit when you’re thinking about switching careers or applying your existing experience to work in a new field. Or maybe you’re returning to work after a period out of the workforce.

Developing a career plan involves three main steps or phases.

 

Discover. Plan. Act.

 

You can use these three simple steps to plan your career.

 

    Discover. Get to know yourself, including your motivations, experiences you want, skills to build, and career goals to achieve. Research and explore opportunities and career paths that interest you and that may not have considered before.

    Plan. Identify a goal and any skills you need to build or to reach that goal. Lay out a plan of how you will achieve that goal.

    Act.Take action on your plan. Identify how to get connected to employers and mentors that can help you. Prepare your resume and social media presence to land that dream job.

 

Get to Know Yourself

 

The first step in managing your career is to get a clear picture of who you are and what you want.

 

This includes:

 

    Knowing what motivates you and what matters in your life

    Identifying your strengths and opportunities to improve

    Finding out what you’re most interested in

 

What we want can change over time—our priorities change, we can discover new interests or skills that we want to develop and learn. This is an opportunity to check in and see where you are today.

 

I know myself and what I want.

 

There are many free self-assessment tools out there to help you identify your own values, skills, and interests. We’ve provided links to a few of them in the resources section. You may want to start by exploring some of these tools.

 

We’ve also provided a Career Exploration Resources pack with worksheets to guide you through each step of the career development process. We recommend downloading it and finding a quiet place where you can work through it.

What Motivates You

 

Think about that day you left work or school thinking “Wow, that was a great day!”

 

Do you remember what was happening? Whatever it was, you were probably doing something that you found motivating and energizing.

 

Get to know what motivates you.

 

What you find motivating is unique to you and it’s the starting point in getting to know yourself.

 

Examples of motivators include:

 

    Creativity and innovation

    Problem-solving

    Being an expert

 

Curious about what motivates you? Complete the Values and Skills Assessment worksheet in the Career Exploration Resources pack you downloaded to identify your top 5.

Next Steps

 

Once you’ve completed your self-assessment, review your results and identify any themes that emerge. It can be helpful to talk over your results with a friend or family member.

 

Next we explore career options and see how they align with the themes you’ve identified.

Explore Career Options

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Describe the different job roles within the Salesforce ecosystem.

    Research potential career options that align to your interests.

    Identify skills and requirements for your target career goal.

 

Researching Career Pathways

 

Now that you’ve looked inward to assess your current skills, interests, and values, it’s time to expand your view outward and explore different pathways that interest you.

 

Perhaps you already have some ideas about roles that interest you. Perhaps you’ve thought about consulting, but aren’t sure what a day in the life is like for that role. Or perhaps there’s a specific industry that interests you, like healthcare or finance, but you’re not sure what the different roles are within that industry. Whatever your starting point, this is an opportunity to cast a wide net to see what options interest you.

 

Here are a few ways to research different career pathways.

 

    Search job descriptions with keywords related to your interest.

    Talk to others who are already in roles you’re interested in.

    Attend industry events and meetups.

    Take people in your network out for coffee or lunch to learn more about other functions, teams, and roles.

    Shadow someone doing what you’d like to do in the future.

    Look for opportunities to be part of a special project to learn new skills.

 

Labor Market Trends

 

One thing to consider as you research career options is the labor market demand for specific skills and roles. What are the jobs and industries experiencing the highest growth, and where are there more opportunities?

 

Salesforce roles span multiple functional areas, including sales, IT, marketing, business management, and operations. As businesses embrace the future of mobile, big data, IoT, and AI, Salesforce skills are becoming some of the hottest skills to have on your resume, and that demand is growing.

 

Knowing where the demand for a specific skill set, such as Salesforce skills, is strong can give you a starting point for researching different career options that draw upon those skills.

 

Here are some places to look for labor market information.

 

    Occupational Outlook Handbook

    Glassdoor’s 50 Best Jobs List

 

A Day in the Life

 

Another factor to consider during your research is the day-to-day activities of different roles. Does the role require more time working with others or working alone? Is the workday structured with lots of meetings or more self-directed? What types of problems does the role solve?

 

Once you’ve identified specific roles that interest you, search online to find more information about a typical day for that role. Use LinkedIn or X to find people in your network with that role and ask to interview them.

 

For Salesforce career pathways, you can read stories from Trailblazers who have built their careers on Salesforce. Or explore a typical day in the life of different career paths on the Salesforce Career Paths site.

Conducting Your Research

 

We’ve provided some information on different career pathways within the Salesforce ecosystem as a starting point for researching career options that interest you. Read through the career profiles, the skills required, what a day in the life of each of these jobs is like, and some of the additional resources provided. You can also expand your exploration outside this list and do your own research on job roles that interest you.

 

Once you’ve identified one or two roles that look interesting, complete the career exploration worksheet in the Career Exploration Resources packet you downloaded to do a deeper dive on those career options.

Land Your Next Opportunity

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Prepare for interviewing by creating your elevator pitch.

    Create your Salesforce resume and profile.

    Connect with employers.

 

Now You're Ready!

 

Now that you know where you’re headed and you’ve created your plan to get there, it’s time to go out and land that next role. We’ve created a job seeker checklist, included in the Resources pack you downloaded, to help you make sure your personal presence is amazing both in person and online.

 

You’re ready!

Update Your Resume

 

If you haven’t updated your resume in a while, it’s time to dust it off and add in your most recent work experience, and any new skills and certifications you’ve earned.

 

If you’re making a major career change or changing industries, consider hiring a professional to help you position your previous experience that is relevant for the new role.

 

Make sure you proofread your resume carefully. Have a friend or family member read it over if you can. You don’t want to miss out on an opportunity because you missed a typo.

 

Here are a few additional tips for creating a rock star resume.

 

       

 

DO THIS

       

 

NOT THIS

 

Use action verbs

       

 

Trained 500 users on new sales processes.

       

 

Responsible for end-user training.

 

Highlight accomplishments

       

 

Designed an automated lead qualification process using Salesforce that resulted in XYZ.

       

 

Automated processes using Salesforce.

 

Be accurate

       

 

Include dates for each position you’ve held.

       

 

Don’t leave off information.

 

Don’t lie or provide incorrect information.

Create Your Elevator Pitch

 

An elevator pitch is the 30-second story of who you are and where you want to go, and it usually ends with a specific ask or request. It’s your personal “commercial.” Hone and practice it until you can deliver it smoothly.

 

Your elevator pitch is the perfect response to questions like, “Tell me about yourself” or “What do you do?” It can prepare you for that chance encounter with the company CEO in the elevator (or in the line at the coffee shop, or anywhere!).

 

You can have slightly different versions of your pitch, depending on who you’re talking to, but the basic structure is the same.

 

Elements to include

       

 

Examples

 

Who are you? What is your goal?

       

 

    I’m an experienced Salesforce administrator looking to move into a consulting role...

    I’m a recent MBA graduate looking for a role at a nonprofit...

 

Why are you pursuing this goal? What is your motivation?

       

 

    I love helping teams optimize their use of Salesforce and tackling new challenges.

    I’ve been an avid hiker and camper since I was a kid, and I want to work for an organization that’s environmentally focused.

 

What are the skills and strengths you bring? What is your key differentiator?

       

 

    I have 5 years’ experience as a Salesforce administrator, and I am a self-taught developer. I’ve earned 85 Trailhead badges and multiple certifications.

    I’ve successfully implemented Salesforce for a nonprofit, and I’m an expert with the Nonprofit Success Pack.

 

What is your ask? What are the next steps?

       

 

    Can I get your business card to follow up and ask you a few questions?

    Do you have any recommendations of people I can speak with?

    Are you available to grab coffee in the next couple weeks?

 

Polish Your Personal Brand

 

Your social media presence is the new resume. Employers and recruiters look to social media to learn more about candidates, so it’s important to make sure your profiles are top notch and that your personal brand is epic, amazing, and every bit as professionally compelling as you are in real life.

 

Consider getting a professional headshot taken to use for all your social media profiles. Or use the best recent photo you have.

 

DO THIS...

       

 

NOT THAT...

 

Your profile picture:

 

    Looks like you

    Is clear and in focus

    Is high-resolution (1400 x 425 pixels)

 

       

 

Your profile picture does not:

 

    Include other people

    Look like you from 10 years ago

    Look out of focus or blurry

 

Salesforce Profiles

 

Complete your profile on Trailhead. Make sure you have a professional photo and use your newly perfected elevator pitch for your bio.

 

X

 

The Salesforce community is on X, so that’s a great place to look for news and information as well as establish yourself as a thought leader.

 

       

 

DO THIS

       

 

NOT THAT

 

X handle

       

 

Choose an X handle that represents you professionally.

 

    One option is to use some version of your name, like @SusanSmith.

    Or use a handle that identifies your area of expertise, like @SusanCRMpro.

 

       

 

Don’t use a handle that can be considered offensive.

 

Profile

       

 

Use a professional photo.

 

Use your 160-character bio to describe to employers your key skills and accomplishments.

 

Include a link to your LinkedIn profile or other site where employers can get more information.

       

 

Don’t write your personal memoir.

 

Don’t leave it blank or empty, and don’t sell yourself short.

 

Content

       

 

Tweet primarily about things that relate to your role or industry (consider setting up two accounts if you do a lot of personal tweeting).

 

Follow people and companies that you’re interested in.

       

 

LinkedIn

 

Show off the skills you’ve acquired on Trailhead by listing your badges and superbadges as well as any certifications.

 

       

 

DO THIS

       

 

NOT THAT

 

Job title and headline

       

 

Use your current actual job title.

 

If you are looking for work use a job title that conveys the type of role that you want to land..

       

 

Your job title shouldn’t lie. Tell it like it is. It’s a small world out there—it’s surprising how many connections you share with others. So keep it honest.

 

Summary section

       

 

Include a short description of yourself and what you do currently.

 

Make sure your contact information is up to date.

 

Market yourself as a leader—if you speak at events or have been recognized in your industry, make sure it’s on your profile.

       

 

Don’t write your personal memoir.

 

Don’t leave it blank or empty, and don’t sell yourself short.

 

Don’t include anything that seems outlandish or too personal.

 

Rich media

       

 

Share content 2 to 3 times a week to keep your name fresh and to establish your professional brand.

 

Add key work examples to your profile where appropriate.

       

 

Don’t add things that aren’t relevant to your career and might confuse the viewer.

 

Don’t overwhelm people by sharing content multiple times per day.

Research Prospective Companies

 

Another important step in creating your career plan is identifying what type of company you want to work for so you can narrow your search. There are many types of companies within the Salesforce ecosystem where Salesforce skills are in demand. Here are a few examples.

 

    Salesforce customers: Salesforce customers span industries and include both large enterprise companies and small and medium-sized businesses. Check out our customer success stories for examples.

    Implementation partners: Our partners, also called system integrators, have deep technology and industry expertise and help get Salesforce up and running. They include international firms, and local and industry-specific partners who can give you a tailor-made implementation.

    AppExchange partners: These are companies that have built applications on the Force.com platform and sell them on AppExchange.

    Nonprofits: There are over 20,000 Salesforce nonprofit customers. See Salesforce.org success stories for examples.

 

Here are some questions to ask yourself in narrowing your search.

 

    Do you prefer working for a small company or a large enterprise?

    Do you prefer a startup or a more established organization?

    What type of company culture do you prefer?

    Do you want to work for a nonprofit or mission-driven organization or a commercial enterprise?

    What industry are you most interested in?

 

Search for Salesforce Opportunities

 

Ready to start your search? In addition to the general job sites such as dice.com, monster.com, and others, there are many specific job boards for Salesforce roles. Here are a few of the job boards.

Workforce Navigators in Action

 

Molly just started a new job at a finance firm that operates on the Salesforce platform. She uses screen magnification in combination with a screen reader to enlarge content on the screen and also have it spoken aloud. She sometimes has trouble using the mouse; she is much faster using the keyboard to get work done. This is her first time using Salesforce, and she is searching for a community where she can pick up tips and tricks while she works her way through Trailhead.

 

Molly has the opportunity to join Workforce Navigators for training, mentorship, and scholarships. She can also tap into the Workforce Navigators written accessibility resources like screen reader instructions and keyboard-only use.

 

In the next unit, we take a closer look at the three key components of Workforce Navigators.

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Describe three ways to participate in the Workforce Navigators program.

    Access the Workforce Navigators website and resources.

    Discover how you can partner with Workforce Navigators.

 

A Three-Tiered Approach to Support

 

As you learned in the previous unit, Workforce Navigators is a workforce development program designed to support professionals with disabilities through mentorship, training, and scholarships. We take a multipronged approach to supporting job seekers with disabilities and training. There are many benefits of Workforce Navigators. Let’s explore!

 

Training

 

When you join Workforce Navigators, Salesforce learning opportunities expand and open up to you, beginning with our rigorous and disciplined training. As part of Workforce Navigators, we offer both intensive, virtual bootcamps and self-paced, online curriculums.

 

Trailhead Virtual Bootcamp is a multi-week program that provides fundamental knowledge and expert-led guidance for building Salesforce skills quickly. Job seekers can join prescriptive bootcamps and learn directly from Salesforce experts through live sessions. Professionals looking to advance their career can find new opportunities and develop skills and prove their expertise by completing Trailhead badges or earning Salesforce certifications through the Bootcamp.

 

To meet individual needs and schedules, job seekers can also get the same hands-on learning at their own pace. This flexible, self-paced option offers access to the Salesforce organization to practice new skills, test knowledge, and review learning resources.

 

Scholarship Programs

 

To help provide access to training for individuals who may need financial assistance, each year we award Trailhead Virtual Bootcamp scholarships to skilled professionals with disabilities who meet certain requirements. To apply, fill out the scholarship application. Currently, the scholarship is only available in the US and Canada.

 

Mentorship Program

 

Everyone deserves the chance to have a mentor. That’s why Salesforce’s Office of Accessibility created a dedicated mentorship program for people with disabilities.

 

Community is a key element for success, and our mentoring program can help you begin building yours. The Workforce Navigators Mentoring Program offers career support to people with disabilities who are exploring roles within the ecosystem, working toward Salesforce certification, or already certified.

 

With Workforce Navigators, you learn from the best. After you sign up for the mentorship program, we assign you a Salesforce employee mentor, who can help guide you through training and information about careers at Salesforce.

 

Consider these mentorship benefits.

 

    Meet with a trusted and skilled mentor at least 2 hours per month.

    Share short-term and long-term career goals for insight and guidance.

    Get actionable advice and suggestions to improve your resume.

    Participate in mock interviews.

 

Currently only available in the US and Canada, check out the mentorship program page to learn about the requirements (there are just a few) and how to enroll as a mentee.

Mentorship in Action

 

Janice has self-identified with a disability and is currently living in the US. She has taken advantage of the Workforce Navigators Program and has taken virtual bootcamp sessions and recently received her admin certification. She is now interested in taking the next step: enrolling in the mentorship program and continuing to build more community with Salesforce and its ecosystem.

 

Janice meets the eligibility requirements to become a part of the mentorship program because she resides within the US or Canada, has a disability, and has completed her admin certification.

 

Even if she were still working on certification, as long as she had completed her classes, she could take advantage of the program.   

 

Exam Accommodations

 

We want trailblazers with disabilities to have the resources they need to be successful in their roles. To move into a new career, inclusion and resources are critical to ensuring your future success. That’s why we provide exam accommodations for the Salesforce Admin certification exam. Learn how to request accommodations on Trailhead Help.

 

Be sure to work with your doctor ahead of time to identify what accommodations you will need before submitting your request.

Corporate and Non-Profit Partners

 

Workforce Navigators relies on the partnership and cooperation of an inclusive ecosystem. The benefits of our program extend well beyond professionals with disabilities working in the Salesforce ecosystem. We partner with workforce development organizations to train, certify, and place people with disabilities. The highly skilled and trained professionals within our program provide an incredible talent pool and pipeline for companies looking to fill roles in the Salesforce ecosystem.

Build Community Through Learning and Networking

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Connect your company with Workforce Navigators.

    Create a case for accessibility blockers.

    Become part of the community of trailblazers with disabilities.

 

Join Our Community

 

Connect

 

At Salesforce, we take great pride in helping pave the way to a more inclusive workforce. We recognize that fostering a more diverse and inclusive culture is a journey. Building community through individual outreach and in partnership with other companies and organizations is a key part of this journey. And it begins with individuals in the community who can help build and make connections with Workforce Navigators.

 

We work with workforce development organizations to train, certify, and place people with disabilities in the Salesforce ecosystem. For example, we have partnerships with nonprofits like the Blind Institute of Technology and BOSMA. The Blind Institute of Technology is a nationwide organization whose aim is to reduce the unemployment rate within the blind and visually impaired community. BOSMA is an organization that partners with businesses to create jobs and training programs for people who are blind.

 

So what does “work with workforce development organizations” really mean? Let’s take a look.

 

Akasia Parran has been legally blind for 5 years. The unmet need in her job search was accessible technology. As part of our partnership with the Blind Institute of Technology, Akasia had the opportunity to take a course that offers professionals with disabilities the chance to gain skills for meaningful employment.

 

The Salesforce free online learning modules offer enhanced accessibility features. For Akasia, that meant that she was able to complete coursework and became a certified Salesforce Administrator in just 6 months.

 

“I wouldn’t have a career without Salesforce’s continuing efforts to create accessible software.” —Akasia Parran

 

To learn more about Akasia’s story, read Breaking Accessibility Barriers and Becoming a Salesforce Pro.

 

As a collective whole, we know we can accomplish far more together than we ever could alone. The support we receive from our nonprofit partners helps us provide accessible accommodations across our entire Salesforce ecosystem. If you’re a professional with a disability pursuing Salesforce credentials, we want you to have the support you need to successfully complete the certification exams.

 

To request an accommodation, follow the steps in this article. Be sure to work with your doctor ahead of time to identify what accommodations you need before submitting your request.

 

And if you’re an HR practitioner looking to establish a workforce development program of your own, contact us at workforcenavigators@salesforce.com. We’re happy to share our learnings, which you can apply in your organization.

 

As we mentioned, we want trailblazers with disabilities to have the resources they need to be successful in their roles. We do this by partnering with companies to upskill their employees, offering free digital training to the public, publishing resources, and more.

 

The Workforce navigators talent pool is strong and made up of an incredible group of highly skilled and diverse individuals. If you’d like to hire from our network, contact us at Workforce Navigators.

Partnership in Action

 

Shirley is an HR manager who wants to find individuals with Salesforce certifications to fill a few open roles. And in parallel with her talent search, Shirley is building a new workforce development program to support professionals with disabilities.

 

Salesforce Workforce Navigators welcomes companies who want to participate in the program and access the Workforce Navigators talent network of professionals. And HR professionals like Shirley can get information about nonprofit organizations that can help her establish training programs. She can also learn tips and approaches from the Salesforce program to apply at her company.

Remove Barriers: Pave the Way for a More Inclusive Hiring Experience

 

Earlier in this unit, we mentioned that achieving inclusion and accessibility is a journey. It’s important to recognize that every company is at a different stage of development for inclusion. As a Trailblazer with a disability or an advocate for inclusion, we can all play a positive role in helping to improve the landscape.

 

Any one of us can be a change agent when we encounter a barrier to success. While most barriers are likely an oversight and not an intentional exclusion, it’s up to us all to drive culture changes that remove barriers and put in place best practices.

 

If you feel you have experienced a barrier at any point in our hiring experience, we want to hear about it. Accessibility blockers on any software platform should be reported to the company’s accessibility team. If you find an accessibility blocker on the Salesforce platform, we welcome your feedback and have a system in place for reporting. Use this article to submit your accessibility issue and create a product accessibility support case.

 

It’s also important to celebrate successes and best-in-class examples of inclusion and accessibility. View our events page for information about upcoming guest lectures. If you have a great story to share about your company, contact us to see if you can become part of our series.

 

Next, let’s consider a scenario where an accessibility barrier prevented a professional from performing at their fullest potential.

Accessibility Barrier Example

 

Jack finds a great role posted online with a company that has a strong reputation for valuing diversity. Jack is a cybersecurity expert and has been deaf since birth. He applies online for the role and is asked to take a few online tests to move forward in the interview process. Excited to begin, he opens the first test and discovers there's a video he must watch and answer questions about. Unfortunately, the video does not have captions. He does poorly on the exam, and the results are not representative of his actual expertise and knowledge.

 

After he completes the test, he reaches out to his hiring contact to let them know the challenges he encountered. As it turns out, they have a version with captioning, and Jack is able to retake the test and successfully continue with the hiring process as a top candidate. And going forward, the company institutes a new policy to embed captioning into all its training videos so that new hires have the option of turning on captioning, as needed.

 

“Do the best you can until you know better. Then, when you know better, do better.” —Maya Angelou, American Poet

Become Part of Our Trailblazing Community

 

Regardless of where you are in your career journey as a job seeker, or what roles you are looking to fill as a hiring manager, the Workforce Navigators program can give you a path to success. We can all learn together and pave a broader and deeper path for inclusion and accessibility. Let’s keep the momentum going and stay in touch to share opportunities for learning and career advancement while playing a part in fostering a culture of inclusion.

Guard Data Transmission

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Define transport layer security (TLS).

    Identify how public key infrastructure (PKI) secures data transmission.

 

Encrypting Data Transmission with TLS

 

One critical link in securing data transmission is to use transport layer security (TLS) to encrypt it. TLS is a cryptographic protocol designed to secure communications over a computer network. A protocol describes how the cryptographic algorithms should be used to secure information. Cryptographic protocols are used to secure transferred messages during application-level data transport. They are widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). But their use as the security layer in Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) remains the most publicly visible instance for secure web browsing.

Using a PKI Service

 

Many organizations use internal services to simplify the process of getting certificates for TLS. If your organization has such a service, you should use it for provisioning and delivering the short-lived certificates to hosts and services upon which TLS relies. If your organization does not have an internal service, you should consider planning for or adopting a public key infrastructure (PKI) service. A PKI service simplifies the process of encryption by setting up a system for acquiring the certificates that TLS uses to authenticate identity.

 

Let’s start by looking at how a PKI service works. PKI is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. Digital certificates establish your credentials when doing business or other transactions on the web. They are issued by a certification authority (CA) who vouches for their authenticity.

 

In cryptography, a PKI is an arrangement that binds public keys with respective identities of entities (like people and organizations). A public key is the key your web browser uses to encrypt or scramble data into ciphertext, which is sent to a website. The data is then decrypted with a private key held by the entity that is authorized to view the data. The binding is established through a process of registration and issuance of certificates at and by a CA. A CA confirms the validity of a website's certificate and, therefore, verifies that the website itself is valid.

 

Diagram that shows how the public key encrypts data on the client side and decrypts it on the server side

 

In general, PKI provides “trust services.” Trust services is the process of ensuring the electronic identification of signatories and services. Trust service objectives respect one or more of the following capabilities: confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

 

Confidentiality: Ensures that no entity can maliciously or unwittingly view your data in cleartext. Data is encrypted to make it secret so that even if it is read, it appears as gibberish. This is why the most common use of PKI for confidentiality purposes is in the context of TLS.

 

Integrity: Ensures that if transmitted data is tampered with in any way, there is clear evidence that it happened. This traceability is a key trust objective of PKI systems.

 

Authenticity: Ensures that you have connection certainty for authentication of data in transit on both the server-side and the client-side of the transmission.

 

These trust services are why organizations use PKI services to generate certificates for data encryption over TLS. A certificate service is basically an organization of services surrounding a CA that allows it to issue, renew, and revoke certificates. Certificates are what pass a public key to computers that need to communicate securely using the PKI system.

 

Your organization most likely has its own customized PKI service to generate the certificates you need to securely encrypt your data in transit using TLS. You should use that system to encrypt data in transit, so that you do not risk exposing yourself and your organization to attackers on the open internet who might wish to do you harm.

Encrypt Data at Rest

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Define the risks to data at rest.

    Explain encryption best practices to protect data at rest.

 

What Is Data at Rest?

 

Data at rest is the data housed on computer data storage in any digital form, whether it's in cloud storage, file hosting services, or databases. Data at rest can even include physical data stored in warehouses, spreadsheets, archives, or tapes. For the purposes of this module, data refers to electronic data.

 

Depending on the core business of your organization, data at rest can be one of the most valuable assets you have. That’s why this type of data is subject to threats from attackers. To prevent this data from being accessed or stolen, organizations often employ security protection measures such as password protection, data encryption, or a combination of both. Let’s take a closer look at encryption of data at rest.

 

Information protected by encryption both at rest and in transit.

Use Encryption to Secure Organization Data at Rest

 

Just as it’s crucial to encrypt data in transit, it’s also important to encrypt sensitive data at rest. This is to ensure that you handle private data securely, and that it stays private. Your goal when encrypting data at rest should be to implement a solution that prevents data visibility in the event of unauthorized access or theft.

 

When protecting data at rest, you want to make sure that encrypted data remains encrypted when other controls fail. Sometimes this is done by combining network segmentation and increasing levels of encryption. Encrypting data on multiple levels is a good way to enhance its safety.

 

At a minimum, you should:

 

    Implement cryptography on the database housing the data and on the physical devices where the databases are stored.

    Update data encryption keys on a regular basis.

    Store encryption keys separately from the data.

    Enable crypto-shredding at the end of the data or hardware lifecycle.

    Audit sensitive data at scheduled intervals.

    Store only the minimum amount of sensitive data.

 

While there are many ways to configure encrypted data at rest systems, here are some basic best practices.

 

Asymmetric cryptography (also known as public-key encryption) uses the difficulty of certain math problems to give you a pair of keys, each of which can be used to encrypt a message so that only the other key in the pair can decrypt it. That means anyone can use the public key to hide something, and only the holders of the private key can unlock it. The holders of the private key can also “sign” any message, and anyone in the world can use the public key to verify it was really signed by them.

 

Asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption as it uses two keys for the process. In a symmetric key system, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, while in an asymmetric system, the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret. Asymmetric cryptography tools include authentication tokens, Docker or Java’s JCA. 

 

Hardware security module (HSM) is hardware that holds private keys and it can be used without disclosing them. While it's running, you can put public-key encrypted information on one end and get decrypted information out of the other, and nobody can ever discover the private key.

 

Defense in depth means applying controls at different layers of your technology stack so that you don’t rely on just one control to protect your data. One way to implement defense in depth when it comes to encryption is to combine your encryption capabilities with asymmetric cryptography and HSM. This means that even if parts of the system are compromised, it is still difficult to access all the data.

 

Strong encryption methods include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA). These are both encryption standards used by governments, technology companies, and other organizations. The difference between them is that AES is a symmetric key system, and RSA is an asymmetric key system. This means that AES uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while RSA uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt data.

Sum It Up

 

In this module, you’ve learned more about protecting data transmission with TLS and PKI, and encrypting data at rest. Using these methods across the board minimizes the chance that attackers can access it. You can learn more about best practices in cybersecurity from real security practitioners by visiting the Cybersecurity Learning Hub on Trailhead.

Safeguard Production Secrets

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Define key management solutions (KMS).

    Explain the value of using a KMS.

    Identify KMS methodologies.

    Define key management terms.

 

What Is a Key Management Solution?

 

Key management solutions (KMS) rely on a set of dedicated servers to administer a full lifecycle of cryptographic keys (keys used to encrypt data) and protect them from loss or misuse. KMS and other key management technologies ultimately control the generation, usage, storage, archival, and deletion of encryption keys. Additionally, to fully protect their loss or misuse, companies must limit access to these keys, either by restricting physical access or controlling user access by creating clear and defined user roles.

 

Data encryption is the bedrock of cybersecurity. Encrypted data remains worthless ciphertext (encrypted or encoded text that is unreadable by humans or computers) to anyone who doesn't have access to the encryption keys. So, key management is—in turn—the key to encrypted data security.

 

Keys unlock your secrets, which means they pose a specific security risk if accessed by an unauthorized user. Somehow, you must keep track of the keys, decide who has access to them, and figure out how they can be accessed without being exposed. This is the central task of any KMS.

Why KMS?

 

KMS is designed to provide application owners a way to generate and manage cryptographic keys. These keys should be protected and managed in a secure and physical computing device—a hardware security module (HSM)—when possible. HSMs are designed and certified to be tamper-evident and intrusion-resistant, and they provide the highest level of physical security.

 

A common mistake people make when encrypting data at rest is to use an inadequate key, or to store the key along with the encrypted data. This is the equivalent of leaving a key under the doormat of your house. It’s the first place a malicious actor looks for a key, and it puts your data in serious danger. Instead, make sure that keys only exist on devices in a transient state. That is, the user should enter them only so that the data can be decrypted and then erased from memory.

 

A thief looks under the doormat of a house and finds the key.

KMS Methodologies

 

There are various KMS methodologies that centralize key generation, distribution, and management. These allow you to maintain control of what keys are in use and who is using them.

 

Traditional Public-Key Solutions

 

One reason keys have been difficult to manage is that in a traditional public-key solution, a key is typically assigned to an individual, server, or organization. This key works like a signature, validating that the data has come from the proper source. In this technology solution, keypairs persist for years at a time, so the key must be carefully guarded against disclosure. Anyone with access to the private key can counterfeit that person's digital signature.

 

Transient-Key Solutions

 

In transient-key solutions, the keypair is assigned to a brief interval of time, not to a particular person or entity. Data signed by a specific private key becomes associated with a specific time and date. A keypair is active only for a few minutes, after which the private key is permanently destroyed. Therefore, unlike public-key solutions, transient-key solutions do not depend upon the long-term security of the private keys. A KMS works as a transient-key solution. Larger organizations use a KMS with an HSM to provide a very high level of security.

Key Management Terms

 

Let’s talk about some cryptographic key terms you might encounter when working with KMS solutions.

 

Password versus key: In Secrets Management for Developers, you learned about the difference between a password and a key. Remember that the primary difference between keys and passwords is that the latter are intended to be generated, read, remembered, and reproduced by a human user. A key, by contrast, is intended for use by the software that is implementing the cryptographic algorithm, so human readability is not required. In fact, most users will, in most cases, be unaware of the existence of the keys being used on their behalf by the security components of their everyday software applications.

 

Symmetric versus asymmetric keys: Asymmetric key algorithms use separate keys for encryption and decryption, while symmetric key algorithms use a single key for both processes. Because an asymmetric algorithm uses multiple keys, the process takes longer to produce than a symmetric key algorithm does. However, the benefit is that an asymmetric algorithm is much more secure than a symmetric key algorithm.

 

Cryptographic hash: This is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit array of a fixed size (the hash value, hash, or message digest). Hashing is a cryptographic process that can be used to validate the authenticity and integrity of various types of input. It is widely used in authentication systems to avoid storing plaintext passwords in databases, but is also used to validate files, documents and other types of data.

 

Cryptographic salt: This is the random data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password, or a passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage.

 

A KMS solution protects your secrets as follows: A developer uses KMS to create or store a secret using the KMS producer service. The producer generates a new secret, embeds authorization by attaching the set of services that are allowed to access it, and encrypts it. The developer receives the resulting encrypted blob to check-in to source control along with their application. The encrypted secret is deployed to production along with the application, where it is decrypted and exposed to code via an in-memory file system.

Manage Your Keys

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Define the key management lifecycle.

    Explain the different approaches to key management solutions (KMS).

 

Key Management Lifecycle

 

Now that you’ve learned how to keep your production secrets safe, let’s talk about the key management lifecycle and why it’s equally important for security. While there are many phases to this lifecycle, key management focuses on creating, maintaining, securing, and controlling the use of cryptographic keys. Monitoring this process allows you to assure that the keys are properly created and deployed. There are four phases to the key management lifecycle, which are important to securing production secrets.

 

    Key Creation and Activation

    Key Revocation

    Key Escrow (Backup)

    Key Deletion (Destruction)

 

Let’s take a closer look at each.

 

Key Creation and Activation

 

A key manager creates the encryption key and stores it in a key storage database along with its attributes: name, activation date, size, and so forth. You can activate keys at creation or set them to activate later.

 

Key Revocation

 

Any key administrator can use the key manager to revoke a key. This places the key in an invalidated state and it can no longer be used for cryptographic purposes like encryption and decryption. If needed, you can reactivate revoked keys. An example of this may be when an old key is required to decrypt data previously encrypted with it.

 

Key Escrow (Backup)

 

Key escrow allows for keys to be securely archived when they deactivate. Much like key revocation, you can reactivate archived keys if required.

 

Key Deletion (Destruction)

 

When a key is no longer necessary or has become compromised, an admin may choose to delete it from the storage database. This removes all or certain instances from the database, making recovery impossible (outside of any stored backups). Should a key become compromised, an admin can immediately delete it, allowing your data to remain secure.A cycle with symbols of each phase of the key management lifecycle: creation and activation, revocation, escrow, and destruction

KMS Strategies

 

An organization can take one of several different approaches when it comes to key management strategies: decentralized, distributed, or centralized.

 

Manage Your Keys—Decentralized (Local)

 

A decentralized key management solution (DKMS) or local key management is an approach to key management where no central authority exists. Individuals bear all the responsibility for creating, securing, managing, and destroying cryptographic keys. An example of this is local backup encryption or a local file vault on a computer.

 

Manage Your Keys—Distributed (Siloed)

 

Another approach is to use a distributed or siloed key management approach, where you consolidate the management for a particular application or system. A common example of this is full disk encryption that is used in large enterprise organizations. The keys for the disk encryption are all managed by a central application that is used specifically for that one purpose.

 

Manage Your Keys—Centralized

 

There is also the option of using a dedicated and centralized KMS (CKMS). Distributed key management solutions become increasingly difficult to manage as your company grows. A CKMS can unify key management across your entire company allowing for scale with the needs of the business. Benefits of a CKMS include providing tamper-evident records for proof of compliance along with streamlining key management processes, automatic key updates, and backup and recovery options.

 

It’s important to note that all of the above methods are available within the cloud, as well as your company’s on-premise system for key management. However, if scalability, auditing, and security are of high concern, CKMS is ideal. By managing keys in a centralized fashion, you reduce operational burdens and associated costs, while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of your keys.

Implement Mobile Application Security

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Identify the Open Web Application Security Project’s mobile security resources.

    List actions to address improper platform usage.

    Describe how to mitigate insecure data storage, communication, and authentication.

    Explain the risk associated with insufficient cryptography.

 

Before You Start

 

If you completed the Mobile Application Security module, then you already know about the mobile application (app) landscape and key skills relevant to mobile application security (appsec) engineering. Now let’s talk about how to leverage the Open Web Application Security Project’s (OWASP’s) mobile security resources to help you address mobile security risks.

OWASP’s Mobile Security Resources

 

OWASP® is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of applications (apps) and software by providing guidelines through local and global conferences and open source software projects. These include the OWASP Mobile Top 10 project, web app project, application programming interface (API) security project, serverless computing project, and much more. In this module, we use the OWASP Mobile Top 10 as a framework to explain the way to implement mobile appsec.

 

As a mobile application security (appsec) engineer, your challenge is to secure an ever-growing and constantly updating mobile app portfolio with finite resources. Thankfully, you can standardize and scale mobile appsec testing using the OWASP Mobile Security Project. The OWASP Mobile Security Project is a centralized resource intended to give developers and security teams the resources they need to build and maintain secure mobile apps. You can use the OWASP’s mobile security resources to build efficient and effective mobile appsec programs. Let’s take a quick look at some of the OWASP’s mobile security resources.

 

OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard

 

The OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) is a standard for mobile appsec. As a mobile appsec engineer, you can use the MASVS to develop more secure apps, and to ensure completeness and consistency of security test results. The goal is to classify mobile security risks and provide developmental controls to reduce their impact or likelihood of exploitation. The MASVS maps directly to the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG).

 

OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide

 

The OWASP MSTG is a project that seeks to define the industry standard for mobile appsec. It covers the processes, techniques, and tools you can use during a mobile appsec test, and an exhaustive set of test cases that enables you to deliver consistent and complete test results. The OWASP MSTG is a comprehensive manual for mobile appsec testing and reverse engineering for iOS and Android mobile security testers.

 

OWASP Mobile Top 10

 

The OWASP Mobile Top 10 list is a great resource for mobile appsec engineers who want to design and secure mobile apps, because many of them are inherently vulnerable to security risks. The OWASP Mobile Top 10 is a mobile security project focused on highlighting security vulnerabilities in mobile apps and the remediation strategies to mitigate the risk associated with them. This list sheds light on technical threats and highlights the risk to the business. Note that this list only covers some of the potential vulnerabilities that can be present in a mobile application and it is not comprehensive.

 

Here are the OWASP Mobile Top 10 Risks.

 

    M1: Improper Platform Usage

    M2: Insecure Data Storage

    M3: Insecure Communication

    M4: Insecure Authentication

    M5: Insufficient Cryptography

    M6: Insecure Authorization

    M7: Poor Code Quality

    M8: Code Tampering

    M9: Reverse Engineering

    M10: Extraneous Functionality

 

Manage Security Risks with the OWASP Mobile Top 10

 

Let’s take a look at how you, as a mobile appsec engineer, can use the OWASP Mobile Top 10 to help better manage security risks in your mobile apps.

 

Angeli is an Android operating system (OS) mobile appsec engineer at a multinational software corporation that develops enterprise mobile apps to manage business operations and customer relations.

Angeli has been tasked with using the OWASP Mobile Top 10 to evaluate her organization’s mobile apps and verify that they’re secure. Let’s follow along as she does so.

 

Note

 

The scenarios below describe examples of each risk but do not represent an exhaustive list of issues that could occur under each risk.

 

M1: Improper Platform Usage

 

This risk covers the misuse of a mobile OS feature or a failure to use platform security controls properly. It might include Android intents, platform permissions, misuse of biometric authentication mechanisms, password storage tools, or some other security control that’s part of the mobile OS.

 

During the evaluation of several of her company’s Android apps, Angeli notices that many of them are storing cryptographic keys on the file system. Because cryptographic keys are commonly used to secure particularly sensitive data they are a primary target for attackers.

 

An unauthorized user could use a variety of attacks to read the keys from the file system. Angeli knows that storing cryptographic material on the standard file system is against Android’s best practices and that her organization is at risk of improper platform usage. She circles back with the development team to help them implement a solution using the Android keystore system to store the cryptographic keys as securely as possible.

 

M2: Insecure Data Storage

 

This risk covers a case where an adversary attains a lost or stolen mobile device or executes malware or another repackaged app on the mobile device. Angeli evaluates the organization’s apps for this risk, and realizes that an app is storing usernames and credentials in plain text in system logs.

 

She circles back with the application development team to see if they performed a threat model on the app prior to release, in order to identify insecure storage as a possible risk. Noticing they did not perform one, she recommends that the application development manager incorporate threat modeling into the development process so that these bugs are identified before release.

 

Angeli further recommends that the development team identify sensitive data that the app processes, stores, or transmits, and validate that the data isn’t unnecessarily exposed. Lastly, Angeli informs the development team to create and implement a plan as soon as possible for remediating and redeploying the mobile app. Angeli works with the development team to perform a root cause analysis to uncover why the vulnerability was not identified before deployment.

 

M3: Insecure Communication

 

This risk covers a case where a threat agent might exploit vulnerabilities to intercept sensitive data while it’s traversing the mobile device’s carrier network and the internet. This can occur if an adversary compromises or monitors your local Wi-Fi network, or if there’s malware on your mobile device capturing the sensitive data in transit.

 

In evaluating her organization’s mobile apps for this risk, Angeli realizes that one of the apps fails to verify that the certificate offered is valid, and instead unconditionally accepts any certificate offered to it by the server. This destroys any mutual authentication capability between the mobile app and the endpoint, and leaves the app vulnerable to manipulator-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks through a transport layer security (TLS) proxy.

 

An MITM attack occurs when a perpetrator positions themselves in a conversation between two parties, such as a user and an application. The intention is to either eavesdrop or to impersonate one of the parties by making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is underway and capturing sensitive data.

 

To address this risk, Angeli works with the app development team to ensure the app only establishes a secure connection after verifying the identity of the endpoint server using trusted certificates in the keystore.

 

M4: Insecure Authentication

 

This risk covers a case where a threat agent exploits authentication vulnerabilities through attacks that use available or custom-built tools. In evaluating the organization’s mobile apps for this risk, Angeli realizes that an app uses a weak password configuration policy to simplify how the user enters a password. She works with the application development team to replace the 4-digit personal identification number (PIN) currently allowed as an authentication credential with a stronger authentication mechanism, to make it more difficult for adversaries to deduce the password.

 

M5: Insufficient Cryptography

 

This risk covers a case where a threat agent has physical access to data that’s been encrypted improperly, or uses mobile malware to take advantage of insufficient encryption on a mobile device. In evaluating her organization’s mobile apps for this risk, Angeli discovers that an app uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, which has been shown to have significant weaknesses. She works with the application development team to re-engineer the app to instead follow the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines on recommended algorithms.

Sum It Up

 

Angeli’s organization is on the road to having more secure apps—but her work here isn’t done. In the next unit, find out how Angeli protects her organization’s apps against the rest of the Mobile Top 10.

Address Mobile Application Risks

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Describe how to address insecure authorization.

    List actions to improve code quality.

    Explain how to mitigate code tampering.

    Identify reverse engineering risks.

    Describe how to prevent extraneous functionality risks.

 

Address Mobile Risks

 

Let’s continue to follow Angeli as she works to secure her organization’s mobile apps, using the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Mobile Top 10 as a guide.

 

M6: Insecure Authorization

 

This risk covers a case where a threat agent exploits authorization vulnerabilities through attacks that use available or custom-built tools. It’s important to recognize the difference between authentication and authorization. Authentication is the act of identifying an individual. Authorization is the act of confirming that the identified individual has the permissions necessary to perform the act. The two are closely related, as authorization checks should always immediately follow authentication of an incoming request from a mobile device.

 

Upon inspecting the organization’s applications (apps) carefully, Angeli discovers that authorization decisions are being executed locally on the client-side of the mobile app during the authentication request. This could lead to a situation where an adversary could tweak an incoming request and masquerade as a member of a group they don’t belong to, to gain access to administrative functionality.

 

Angeli works with the developers to update the app to authorize the roles and permissions of authenticated users using only information contained in back-end systems. She reminds them it’s important to avoid relying on any roles or permission information that comes from the mobile device itself.

M7: Poor Code Quality

 

This risk covers the case where a threat agent passes untrusted inputs to method calls (operators used to call self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task) made within mobile code. Threat actors typically exploit these poor code quality issues via malware or phishing scams.

 

Working with the mobile app pen testing team, Angeli learns that the team has been able to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in one of the organization’s apps. The exploit allows them to write into areas known to hold executable code and replace it with malicious code. She works with the development team to reengineer the code by marking certain regions within the code as nonexecutable—a technique known as executable space protection. They also implement bounds checking to automatically check that data written to a buffer is within acceptable boundaries. Finally, Angeli works with the team to implement an automated process to identify future buffer overflows through the use of third-party static analysis tools.

 

M8: Code Tampering

 

This risk covers the case where the organization’s apps do not implement code signing. The lack of code signing allows an attacker to tamper with the app’s code. Typically, this attack occurs when an attacker tweaks a legitimate app’s code after downloading it from a popular app store. The attacker modifies the app to include malicious code then uploads it to a lesser known third-party app store, where an unsuspecting user downloads it.

 

Angeli discovers that an attacker has created a counterfeit version of one of her organization’s apps. The counterfeit version captures and transmits the user’s personally identifiable information (PII), along with their username/password, to a third-party site. This allows the attacker to use the information for fraudulent purposes.

 

Angeli contacts both app stores to inform them of the fraudulent use. She provides her app’s signature (distinctive, pattern-based detection methods which use expressions or marks for identifying app traffic), so the store can verify that her company is the legal owner of the app. They remove the unauthorized copies of the app from their stores, replacing it with the signed version. Angeli puts in place a plan to continually monitor the major app stores to check for any new unauthorized versions that have been published, and to submit new reclaiming requests on a regular basis.

 

M9: Reverse Engineering

 

This risk covers the case where an attacker downloads the targeted app from an app store and analyzes it within their own local environment using a suite of different tools to see how it works. The attacker uses reverse engineering to reveal sensitive and unencrypted information about back-end servers, cryptographic constants and ciphers, intellectual property, and more.

 

Working with the mobile app pen testing team to evaluate one of the organization’s apps, Angeli discovers that an attacker would be able to run strings against the unencrypted app and find a hard-coded connection string that contains authentication credentials to a back-end database. An attacker could use those credentials to gain access to the database and steal PII data about the app’s users. Angeli consults with the development team on a remediation, and they decide to remove the hard-coded connection string and replace the functionality with a server side access controlled API to provide the required data to the application.

 

M10: Extraneous Functionality

 

This risk covers the case where an attacker seeks to understand extraneous functionalities or unnecessary components within a mobile app to discover hidden functionality in back-end systems. The attacker can typically exploit extraneous functionality directly from their own systems without any involvement by end users.

 

Working with the organization's pen testing team, Angeli discovers that the mobile app developers included backdoor functionality in one of the organization’s apps that was not intended for release into production environments. An attacker could discover this functionality and use it to execute back-end administrative functions. To prevent this from happening in the future, Angeli works with her organization to implement manual, secure code reviews using subject matter experts most knowledgeable with this code.

 

The subject matter experts make sure to examine the app’s configuration settings to discover any hidden switches, remove test code from the final production release, and examine all application programming interface (API) endpoints accessed by the mobile app to verify that they’re well documented and publicly available. They also examine log statements to ensure nothing overly descriptive about the back end is being written to the logs. Thanks to the OWASP Mobile Top 10, Angeli’s organization is now much more secure.

Test Mobile Applications

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Identify the differences between static application security testing and dynamic application security testing.

    Define interactive application security testing and runtime application self-protection.

 

Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing

 

As mobile applications (apps) continue to grow as an attack vector, your organization should prioritize mobile application security (appsec) to fortify its overall security posture. Adversaries employ both static attacks based on source code itself and dynamic attacks that exploit app functionality. Understanding and remediating mobile app vulnerabilities in your code is vital for your mobile appsec program.

 

Mobile appsec testing is the process of analyzing mobile apps to find security weaknesses, such as misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. Testing your apps regularly decreases the chance of vulnerabilities occuring or being exploited. Static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) are the most popular evaluation techniques available to you in order to secure mobile apps during the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

 

Static Application Security Testing

 

SAST is about the prevention of defects, whereas DAST is about finding and fixing the defects. While you perform SAST testing in the early stages of the SDLC, before deploying code into production environments, you perform DAST later in the lifecycle. Static and dynamic testing complement one another, and each type has a distinct approach to detecting bugs.

 

You use SAST to analyze source code for known vulnerabilities as a form of white-box testing that scans and analyzes source code at rest from the inside out. SAST is programming-language dependent. You perform SAST to check the defects in software without actually executing the code of the mobile app. SAST tooling scans the source code looking for potentially vulnerable patterns and provides a list of results that then are triaged to weed out false positives. A false positive is a mislabeled security vulnerability indicating there is a threat when, in actuality, there isn't.

 

A hand holding a mobile phone with an SAST checklist on the screen

 

SAST is often referred to as verification: the evaluation of the development process. Though the most mature and easiest to deploy of the appsec testing tools, SAST scans are slow and often prone to high false-positive rates when identifying potential vulnerabilities.

 

Dynamic Application Security Testing

 

DAST is a form of black-box testing you perform by executing the mobile app’s code. You use it to look for vulnerabilities by simulating external attacks on an application while it runs in a test environment. You use DAST to penetrate an application from the outside by checking its exposed interfaces for weaknesses.

 

In DAST, you work with the actual mobile app, not some artifact or model that represents the system. You provide an input, receive output, and compare the output to the expected behavior. You use test cases for testing processes and study how the code behaves during execution. DAST is often referred to as validation: the evaluation of a finished product. You do this testing as one of the last steps before deployment in a test environment, and after code deployment. As a result, fixing problems at this stage becomes more expensive because the product is actively in use.

 

DAST is programming-language agnostic and is a good method for preventing regressions. However, it’s hard to automate and scale because you need experienced security professionals to tailor these test tools to specific use cases, making it more difficult to create a comprehensive testing strategy for each app. DAST also cannot pinpoint the exact source of the problem (for example, the line of code). Furthermore, it can generate a lot of false positives.

 

Examples of methodologies for dynamic testing are unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.

 

    Unit Testing: Testing of individual modules by developers

    Integration Testing: Testing the interface between different modules when they are joined

    System Testing: Testing performed on the system as a whole

    Acceptance Testing: Testing done from the user’s point of view

 

The following table summarizes the differences between SAST and DAST.

While both tools have their advantages and disadvantages, using them in tandem—along with interactive application security testing (IAST) and runtime application self-protection (RASP)—helps strengthen your app’s security, one testing technique at a time. Let’s take a look!

Interactive Application Security Testing and Runtime Application Self-Protection

 

Interactive Application Security Testing

 

SAST and DAST only provide a snapshot in time of a mobile app’s security weaknesses. These tools alone can’t keep up with today’s agile SDLC processes. This means that development, operations, and security teams are often one step behind as they develop, test, and transition software into production environments. To make it easier for businesses, appsec tool manufacturers realized that SAST and DAST techniques could be merged together to create better, more efficient tools that would include the advantages of both. This is how interactive application security testing (IAST) was born.

 

IAST analyzes code for security vulnerabilities while the app is run by an automated test, human tester, or any activity “interacting” with the app functionality. While DAST provides an outside perspective on the app before it goes live, IAST uses software instrumentation (an ability to monitor or measure the level of a product's performance and diagnose errors) to analyze running apps.

 

IAST techniques cover more code, produce better results, and verify a broader range of security rules faster than either SAST or DAST tools working alone. IAST solutions deploy agents and sensors in running apps and continuously analyze all app interactions initiated by manual tests, automated tests, or a combination of both, to identify vulnerabilities in real time. If a vulnerability is detected, the tester or testing team is notified.

 

This analysis allows developers to pinpoint the source of an identified vulnerability and fix it quickly. IAST also produces less false positives and false negatives (misidentified security vulnerabilities that claim you don’t have vulnerability when you do) than SAST and DAST, decreasing the workload on scarce security resources and making it easier to identify the most critical flaws.

 

IAST tools are not confined to a particular phase of the SDLC. Even though they deliver a lot of value during the development phase, because they help developers fix risks in real time, IAST tools are incredibly useful during the testing phase as well. They’re also valuable when the system is in production, because operations and appsec teams can benefit from the risk detection, with little performance hit and little risk of false positives. While IAST tools can provide good benefits, they also are more complex to implement correctly and require mature security development practices and comprehensive build integration in order to recognize their benefits.

 

Runtime Application Self-Protection

 

While IAST monitors an app for security vulnerabilities while it’s running, runtime application self-protection (RASP) monitors an app to detect and prevent fraudulent activities even before it runs, effectively protecting the app from both known and unknown (zero-day) attack vectors. You can use RASP to gain insight into an app's internal data and state, and identify threats at runtime that may have otherwise been overlooked by other security solutions. When an app begins to run, RASP can protect it from malicious input or behavior by analyzing both the app's behavior and the context of that behavior.

 

One advantage of RASP is that it requires minimal intervention of an administrator during deployment. When a security event in an app occurs, RASP takes control of the app and addresses the problem. In diagnostic mode, RASP will simply sound an alarm that something is amiss. In protection mode, it will try to stop it. For this reason, RASP can be beneficial to businesses with lean security resources because it can automatically block attacks on the spot without the need for human intervention. It’s important to first implement RASP in diagnostic mode, to observe how the tool makes decisions, before implementing protection mode.

 

You likely use other technologies such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and web application firewalls (WAF) to protect your apps at runtime, but these technologies work in-line as they inspect network traffic and content. Although they analyze traffic and user sessions to and from apps, they cannot see how traffic and data are being processed within apps themselves. Additionally, instead of analyzing preset signatures or known patterns based on commonly known attacks, as a WAF would, you can use RASP to look for suspicious actions taking place in the app.

Sum It Up

 

You now have a better understanding of how to use SAST, DAST, IAST, and RASP to test and secure your mobile apps.

 

Next, let’s turn to how to use network and mobile app penetration testing (pen testing) to further secure them.

Implement Network and Mobile Application Pen Testing

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Explain network testing.

    Describe mobile application penetration testing.

 

Network Testing

 

Mobile devices regularly connect to a variety of networks, including public Wi-Fi networks shared with other (potentially malicious) clients. This creates opportunities for a wide variety of network-based attacks ranging from simple to complex and old to new. Therefore, it’s vital to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information exchanged between the mobile application (app) and remote service endpoints.

 

One best practice is to verify your mobile app sets up a secure, encrypted channel for network communication using the latest version of transport layer security (TLS) protocol with appropriate settings.

 

Network security specialists, pen testers, and mobile application security (appsec) engineers conduct regular pen testing and vulnerability checks to enable smooth and secure functioning of mobile apps. They test how the app performs under various network types, connection speeds, and quality levels including slow and interrupted connections. They also attempt to circumvent the security of the app by trying to exploit the app’s functionality through pen testing.

Mobile Application Pen Testing

 

A mobile app pen test emulates an attack specifically targeting a custom mobile app and aims to enumerate all vulnerabilities within the app. Pen testing can be used across the entire spectrum of an IT infrastructure, including network, web application, and database. But today, we also see pen testing used widely for another segment: mobile appsec.

 

 

 

You perform pen tests of mobile apps for security vulnerabilities by using either manual or automated techniques to analyze the app. You use these techniques to identify security flaws that may occur in the mobile app. Your purpose in pen testing is to ensure that the mobile app is not vulnerable to attack and that mitigations are in place to prevent exploitation.

 

Pen testing requires a diligent effort to find weaknesses, just like an attacker would. You perform deep-dive testing into local on-device security issues, back-end web services, and the application programming interfaces (APIs) that connect them. You customize assessments to specific concerns, such as reverse engineering an iOS app or malware threats to an Android app.

 

During pen testing, you simulate multiple attack vectors and risks, including insecure storage, stolen device risk, mobile malware attacks, and both authenticated and unauthenticated app users. By conducting pen testing, you can gain insights into the application’s vulnerabilities, bottlenecks, and attack vectors before an adversary is able to discover and exploit them. This way, once you identify an app’s shortcomings, your developers can put in fixes to plug these gaps and change the design to address the issues at hand.

 

Broadly speaking, mobile app pen testing methodologies include the following stages.

 

    Discovery: You gather information, which will further form the basis of the pen testing phases.

    Assessment and analysis: You assess the app using static application security testing (SAST), reverse engineering, dynamic application security testing (DAST), and more.

    Exploitation: You find hidden cues which can successfully shed light on different vulnerabilities.

    Reporting: You report the findings via technical reports and executive-level papers.

 

Sum It Up

 

In this module, you’ve been introduced to the OWASP Mobile Top 10 as a way to identify and mitigate mobile appsec risks. You’ve also learned how to test mobile apps using a variety of techniques.

 

Along with the information you reviewed in the Mobile Application Security module, you should now have a better understanding of what it takes to be a mobile appsec engineer. You can learn more about the in-demand cybersecurity skills needed to get a job in mobile appsec, or another field, and learn more from real security practitioners by visiting the Cybersecurity Learning Hub on Trailhead.

Score Risks

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Identify information assets, Safeguards, and vulnerabilities.

    Evaluate current Safeguard Maturity.

    Describe how the Center for Internet Security, Inc.’s (CIS®) Risk Assessment Method (RAM) automatically scores risks.

 

Note

 

This module was produced in collaboration with the CIS. Learn more about partner content on Trailhead.

Before You Start

 

If you completed The Center for Internet Security's Risk Assessment Method module, then you already know how to develop Risk Assessment and Acceptance Criteria. Now let’s talk about how to use the Center for Internet Security, Inc.’s (CIS) Risk Assessment Method (RAM) to model and evaluate risks and recommend and evaluate CIS Safeguards.

 

Note

 

Throughout this module, we capitalize common words when referring to a specific component of CIS RAM Version 2.1.

Identify Information Assets, Safeguards, and Vulnerabilities

 

As a cybersecurity risk manager, you can model risks by associating information assets with the CIS Safeguards that protect them, the vulnerabilities that may be present, and the threats that can compromise these information assets. CIS RAM helps analyze risk by describing the component steps regardless of sequence.

 

    Identify an information asset or asset class, such as a specific firewall or a set of similarly managed firewalls, an application, or a set of identically configured servers, and more.

    Identify threats that can compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of those information assets or Asset Classes.

    List CIS Safeguards that protect the information asset or Asset Class against foreseeable threats.

    Indicate if you have implemented the CIS Safeguards in the environment and how you have implemented them.

    Consider any vulnerabilities that may exist related to each Safeguard and Asset Class. You, as a cybersecurity risk manager, should take care to consider what can go wrong, even if you have implemented Safeguards. Safeguards can have vulnerabilities such as errors in administration, new threats, intentional harm, failed systems, and insufficient skills or resources.

 

Let’s check in with Sean, the risk assessor at Custom Car Company (CCC), as he continues to fill out his Risk Register in CIS RAM for Implementation Group 2 (IG2) Version 2.1 (v2.1) Companion Workbook.

 

Sean filling out his Risk Register using CIS RAM for IG2 v2.1 Companion Workbook

 

Using the workbook, Sean first selects an Asset Class such as Enterprise, Devices, Applications, Data, Network, or Users.

 

Next, he describes the Asset Name. He selects the CIS Safeguard # and Title that applies to the Asset Class he selected. He then documents how CCC has implemented that Safeguard, including optionally adding Evidence of Implementation, and states any Vulnerabilities that may be exploited by a threat.

 

Note

 

This table represents just a few examples of the information Sean inputs.

Our Implementation

       

 

We use a software asset management tool that monitors for applications installed on all servers and end-user systems.

       

 

A software asset management tool validates that installed applications are currently supported and that the organization implements current versions.

       

 

The software asset management tool identifies installed applications that were not permitted and alerts the Operations (Ops) team. The Ops team removes unapproved applications within 5 business days.

Users have administrative rights to install software on their laptops, but we don’t enforce security reviews on that software before installation.

 

Now that Sean has documented CCC’s assets, associated CIS Safeguards, and Vulnerabiliites, he next turns to evaluate the current maturity of CIS Safeguards at CCC.

Evaluate Current Safeguard Maturity

 

As the next step in evaluating risks, Sean selects a score of 1 through 5 designating the reliability of each Safeguard’s effectiveness against threats, using the following definitions.

 

    He did not implement the Safeguard, or implemented it inconsistently.

    He implemented the Safeguard  fully on some assets, or partially on all assets.

    He implemented the Safeguard on all assets.

    He tested the Safeguard and corrected inconsistencies.

    He has put in place mechanisms for the Safeguard to ensure consistent implementation over time.

 

He populates the Safeguard Maturity Score column in the risk register with his selections.

Automatically Score Risks

 

The VERIS Community Database Index

 

Sean now has documented CCC’s assets, their associated Vulnerabilities, and the maturity of CCC’s current CIS Safeguard implementation in protecting against those Vulnerabilities.

 

CIS RAM Version 2.1 (v2.1) Companion Workbook automatically calculates a value to represent how commonly a related threat causes reported cybersecurity incidents. The VERIS Community Database (VCDB) Index column displays this number. This score evaluates the commonality of a threat that a given Safeguard prevents.

 

Expectancy Score

 

CIS RAM v2.1 Companion Workbook also automatically calculates an Expectancy Score by comparing the commonality of reported threats to the maturity of the Safeguards that prevent the threats.

 

Note

 

For more detailed information on how the CIS RAM Version 2.1 (v2.1) Companion Workbook calculates the Expectancy Score, see Appendix C of the CIS-RAM for Implementation Group 2 (IG2) v2.1 PDF.

 

Impacts

 

Recall that in The Center for Internet Security's Risk Assessment Method module, Sean defined Mission Impact, Operational and Financial Objectives Impact, and Obligations Impact for each Asset Class (Enterprise, Devices, Applications, Data, Network, Users), as part of the process of estimating inherent risk criteria. The CIS RAM v21 Companion workbook automatically populates these magnitudes of harm.

 

Risk Score and Risk Level

 

Once Sean populates the Safeguard Maturity Score column of CIS RAM v2.1 Companion Workbook, the workbook automatically populates Risk Score and Risk Level.

 

The workbook calculates the Risk Score by multiplying the Expectancy Score by the highest Impact Score. The resulting Risk Level is either green, yellow, or red. These colors indicate whether the risk evaluated as “acceptable” as Sean described it in his Risk Acceptance Criteria in the previous module.

 

    Green indicates that the risk evaluates as acceptable.

    Yellow indicates that the risk is unacceptably high, but not urgent.

    Red indicates that the risk is urgent.

 

Sean’s completed Risk Register now looks like this:

See What the Customer Sees

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    List the benefits of Visual Remote Assistant.

    Describe how a technician or agent uses Visual Remote Assistant.

 

Meet the Ursa Major Solar Team

 

Ursa Major Solar is an innovative solar company in the American Southwest. It sells individual solar products and complete solar power systems. It uses Field Service to manage the field service team that installs and repairs solar systems. Let’s meet a few members of the team working to improve the field service journey for its customers.

 

    CEO and cofounder Sita Nagappan-Alvarez. She makes key decisions about software purchases. She’s always on the lookout for ways to improve customer service while keeping her employees happy.

    Salesforce admin Maria Jimenez. She’s the go-to person for setting up and maintaining Salesforce and Field Service. If you have a question about Salesforce, Maria has the answer.

    Customer support agent Ada Balewa. She takes customer calls and solves their problems. Sometimes she refers customers to technicians, and sometimes she solves their problems herself.

    Field Service technician James Clifton. He fixes customers’ solar products. James works with all Ursa Major Solar’s products, and he’s happy to bring sunshine to its customers.

 

Make Service Easier and Safer for Customers

 

Sita keeps Ursa Major Solar at the forefront of the industry by making sure she knows what her customers want and what they don’t. These days, customers don’t want to have service technicians in their homes as often. While they’re happy with the service provided by technicians like Ada and James, they’d like to have Ursa Major help them perform simple jobs themselves.

 

Having agents or technicians investigate problems in customers’ homes without going inside seems like an unsolvable problem. Then Sita discovers Visual Remote Assistant. Visual Remote Assistant lets a contact center agent or remote technician see what the customer sees via video session. Now Ursa Major can provide the same exceptional service without being in the customer’s house using real-time visual support. A quick wave of a customer’s mobile device shows the agent or technician which product is installed, the settings it’s currently using, and more.

 

Visual Remote Assistant ties into Ursa Major’s existing Field Service product, so remote technicians can easily see customer information. Details like product type, installation date, and previous visits to the customer’s home are easy to access. Technicians don’t waste time asking questions they’ve asked before and save time for the customer and Ursa Major. Even better, customer problems are often resolved in the first call, without the customer having to schedule a service call and wait for a technician.

 

What they see varies depending on how it’s set up in their org, but here’s what an Ursa Major agent or technician sees during a call.

 

Graphic showing the incoming phone call, customer information, and the pane to launch Visual Remote Assistant.

 

    Call (1)—What the customer sees during the Visual Remote Assistant session.

    Customer information (2)—The agent or technician’s page shows customer contact information, the installed assets, past work orders for this customer, and more.

    Visual Remote Assistant pane (3)—Where an agent or technician starts Visual Remote Assistant, allowing them to see what the customer sees and guide them to resolve their issue.

 

Visual Remote Assistant in Action

 

Let’s say that Ada Balewa is on the phone with a customer named Violet Winkle. Violet is having trouble with a leaky solar hot water heater. Ursa Major has been called out before about this leaky hot water heater, so Ada quickly reads the notes in the work order on that visit. Ada suspects a loose pipe fitting, but she has to see the hot water heater to be sure.

 

She suggests that they transition to a video call so she can see what’s going on with Violet’s hot water heater. Violet agrees and Ada uses Visual Remote Assistant to send a text to Violet. Violet taps the link and it sends her to a web page in her mobile browser. She approves the terms and conditions and allows Visual Remote Assistant to access her phone’s camera for the duration of the call. Now Ada can see everything that Violet sees.

 

Ada asks Violet to point her phone at the leak and follow it back. She quickly spots the problem. It’s a leaking pipe fitting, just like she thought. When she tries to explain its location, Violet doesn’t understand, so Ada draws a big red arrow on her screen. Because Visual Remote Assistant uses augmented reality, the arrow shows up on Violet’s phone screen too. Now they can both see where the problem is.

 

Ada tells Violet to turn the fitting to the right to tighten it. After Violet does, she wipes off the pipe with a towel and checks that it’s no longer leaking. Problem solved! Violet takes a picture of the fixed pipe and it’s added to her user record so the next time she calls, Ursa Major will have that history.

 

Visual Remote Assistant allows Ursa Major to resolve issues the first time around. If more help is needed, agents or technicians can add a subject matter expert to the session.

 

If they can’t solve the problem right away, the agent or technician can figure out the next steps. Next steps include things like ordering parts, walking the customer through installing the new parts, or scheduling an onsite service call.

 

Let’s watch a company resolving a customer problem using Visual Remote Assistant.

 

Sita understands the value that Visual Remote Assistant can bring to Ursa Major Solar. She’s happy to see that it allows Ursa Major a way to deliver exceptional service from anywhere. Then the team can give the customer real-time visual feedback to diagnose and even fix problems without going onsite. She’s excited to use Visual Remote Assistant at Ursa Major.

Train Employees

 

Ada and James work together to develop a training program for agents and technicians. Ada is responsible for the agent perspective and James focuses on how technicians use Visual Remote Assistant.

 

They create a list of common scenarios that can benefit from a visual connection to the customer. The list includes basic in-home repairs. Here’s part of Ursa Major’s list of tasks that customers can perform. It’s not a full list, but it gives you a sense of Ursa Major’s goals.

 

    Examine hot water heaters leaking inside the house for loose connections or defective parts.

    If solar panels on the ground are losing efficiency, visually inspect them for loose debris.

    Check to make sure that all connections are securely fastened.

    Use optical character recognition (OCR) to convert barcodes, QR codes, and more into text to look up panel warranty, item number, and more.

 

Then they create a list of common scenarios where a visit must be scheduled. For example, some tasks are too dangerous for a customer to attempt. Instead, a knowledgeable technician must come onsite to fix the problem. Ursa Major never compromises on customer safety.

 

    Don’t attempt to fix problems with electrical components that could shock or injure the customer.

    Don’t have customers climb onto their roof or go to any area that’s dangerous to access.

    Don’t disassemble complex components that require a delicate touch or specialized expertise.

 

Finally, they list the tasks that agents and technicians must perform to use Visual Remote Assistant.

 

    Decide if it’s a case for Visual Remote Assistant.

    Locate and start Visual Remote Assistant.

    Walk customers through connecting their mobile device.

    Take pictures to include in the record or forward to a subject matter expert.

    Use augmented reality to add information to a customer’s phone display, like arrows or circles.

    Know when to add a subject matter expert to the agent’s ongoing session.

    Know when to schedule a follow-up appointment.

 

Now that Ada and James have the training information, they decide to create a Sales Enablement badge to train their team members. After a team member completes the badge, they shadow a trained team member for a day to see Visual Remote Assistant in action. After that, they’re ready to start helping customers in a whole new way.

 

In this module, you learned the benefits of Visual Remote Assistant and how agents and technicians use it to work with customers. Then, an Ursa Major admin installed the Visual Remote Assistant managed package. Finally, Ursa Major trained team members to help customers solve their problems more quickly and easily than ever before.

Learn the Foundations of Carbon Accounting

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to: 

 

    Explain the basic Greenhouse Gas (GHG) accounting principles.

    Describe the different objects that work to create a carbon accounting framework.

 

Before We Start

 

If you completed the Net Zero Cloud Basics module, then you already know how Northern Trail Outfitters uses Net Zero Cloud to support and scope their climate strategy. Not to mention Net Zero Cloud Admin Essentials module which outlined how an admin can set up and configure the application. If you haven’t completed these modules, we recommend taking them to have more context as you dive into carbon accounting.

Account for Your Actions

 

The world is in a climate crisis and the need to reduce carbon emissions has never been more urgent. Regulators, investors, and customers are urging companies to get to net zero faster. Companies are faced with the challenge of tracking the complete spectrum of their value chain emissions, which can be a complex and cumbersome process. In this module, we’ll look at how Net Zero Cloud can help you meet that challenge.

 

Northern Trail Outfitters (NTO) is using Salesforce’s Net Zero Cloud to collect, analyze, and report energy usage data and track their carbon footprint. As a part of its net zero commitment, NTO plans to track its carbon footprint and set long-term goals to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

How Net Zero Cloud Can Help

 

Today, companies are generally expected to gather data on their emissions-producing activities, calculate, and report their contribution to atmospheric emissions, and reduce emissions across all three scopes. Check out this help topic to see examples of how emissions are qualified as scope 1, 2, and 3. Net Zero Cloud makes this entire carbon accounting process easy and streamlined for a company like NTO. Net Zero Cloud provides the tools to quantify and measure carbon emissions, and helps companies make informed decisions about which mitigation strategies will be most effective.

 

In Net Zero Cloud, all emissions are converted to their carbon dioxide equivalents and are reported in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e). Wondering what tCO₂e means? tCO₂e is a standardized unit for counting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, regardless of whether they're from carbon dioxide or another gas, such as methane, nitrous oxide, or one of the dozens of refrigerants used throughout the world today.

 

Net Zero Cloud helps companies create an annual emissions inventory. A GHG inventory is the basis for efforts to reduce emissions and their associated environmental impacts. Once you know what your emissions are, it’s easier to tackle the process of reducing the impact of these emissions. An accurate GHG inventory also helps companies forecast emissions in future years.

 

Calculating GHG emissions also enables companies like NTO to set science-based emissions reduction targets. An accurate GHG inventory is the required starting point for determining which targets should be set and for determining how to quantify these targets.

 

Let’s follow along as Sam Rajan, the Chief Sustainability Officer at NTO, explores carbon accounting using Net Zero Cloud for all stationary and vehicle asset sources.

 

Sam Rajan, the Chief Sustainability Officer at NTO.

Explore the Building Blocks of Carbon Accounting

 

There are four key building blocks in Net Zero Cloud that help users manage the carbon accounting process.

 

    Emissions Sources: Emissions sources represent the assets of an enterprise that generate carbon emissions. The three types of emissions sources in Net Zero Cloud are:

 

        Stationary Asset Environmental Sources: Assets that are stationary in nature, such as office buildings, data centers, or warehouses.

        Vehicle Asset Emissions Sources: Assets that are mobile in nature, such as company vehicles or private jets.

        Scope 3 Emissions Sources: Scope 3 activities that are the source of emissions, such as transportation, purchase of raw materials, hotel stays, and so on. This category of emissions results from the activities of the company that are from sources not owned or controlled by the company.

 

    Energy Use Records: Energy use records are created for a specific date or date range and are associated with an emissions source. Examples include monthly electricity consumption for a stationary asset or a single commercial flight record. Users can enter energy consumption information, such as the quantity of electricity, diesel, or natural gas consumed, over a specific period of time in various units of measure that are specific to the activity or fuel being consumed. Based on the emissions factors referenced by the energy use record, Net Zero Cloud does the work for you by converting the entered consumption into carbon emissions.

    Emissions Factors: Emissions factors are used to convert energy consumption into GHG emissions. Several emissions factors in the form of reference datasets from standard government or private sources are preconfigured in Net Zero Cloud. Examples include the eGRID dataset for electricity subgrid emissions in the United States and the EEIO datasets that estimate tCO2e per monetary output across most of the 8 upstream scope 3 categories. Emissions factors specific to a region, business sector, or country can also be added to Net Zero Cloud.

    Carbon Footprints: A carbon footprint is an estimate of the amount of CO2e released to the environment during the lifecycle of a product or an activity. Carbon footprints primarily exist to summarize values from multiple energy use records. There are three types of carbon footprints in Net Zero Cloud, corresponding to the three types of emissions sources.

 

        Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint: Contains overall emissions by scope, summarized from underlying energy uses for a stationary asset across all fuel types. Net Zero Cloud automatically creates Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Item records to show summarized emissions information for a single fuel type.

        Vehicle Asset Carbon Footprint: Contains overall emissions by scope, summarized from underlying energy uses for a vehicular asset.

        Scope 3 Carbon Footprint: Contains overall emissions from underlying energy uses for a scope 3 activity. While you can associate a Scope 3 Emissions Source to the carbon footprint record, you can also associate a stationary source. For example, a warehouse can be the epicenter of scope 3 activities such as purchase of goods and services, transportation and distribution, and waste generation. You can associate the required energy use records and procurement summary records to determine from which activities you want to calculate emissions.

 

Now that Sam understands the building blocks for carbon accounting, he maps out the connections between these objects.

Track Emissions for Stationary Assets

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    List the key fields on a stationary asset environmental source record.

    Explain how to specify values for key fields on stationary asset energy use records.

    Show a simple calculation of emissions on a stationary asset energy use record.

 

Take Stock of Your Buildings

 

Stationary asset environmental sources are used to represent all buildings and data centers associated with a company. Let’s look at how Sam handles this for NTO. Since all of NTO’s stationary asset records come with a few key fields, Sam creates a record for the NTO Headquarters and reviews and populates the key fields.

 

A stationary asset environmental source record showing details for NTO Headquarters Miami.

 

Let’s take a deeper dive into these fields and what they represent.

 

Field

       

 

Description

       

 

Impact on Calculations

 

Carbon Emissions Scope Allocation

       

 

The object that specifies the GHG Protocol scope of emissions for different fuels. Each fuel type has its own scope allocation record in the Carbon Emissions Scope Allocation Values object.

       

 

This field helps the user specify the scope to which the emissions from each fuel is allocated.

 

Refrigerant Emissions Factor

       

 

The object that holds the global warming potential (GWP) for cooling refrigerants, such as CFCs, HFCs, and HCFCs used in stationary asset sources. You can create one record per refrigerant type.

       

 

To properly calculate tCO₂e from refrigerant leakage, the refrigerant’s GWP is multiplied by the quantity of refrigerant leakage.

 

Electricity Emissions Factor Set

       

 

The object that holds a range of information that's relevant to calculating the scope 2 emissions generated from electricity. The GHG Protocol provides two methods for tracking scope 2 emissions: the market-based method and the location-based method. There are fields specific to both of these methods in the electricity emissions factor set.

       

 

Yearly datasets from sources such as Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) website can be uploaded to accurately calculate electricity-based emissions in a specific postal code.

 

Other Emissions Factor Set

       

 

The object that holds predefined emissions and conversion factors for emissions resulting from use of natural gas, propane, and on-site diesel use. While in the other emissions factor record, you can define the global warming potential values for CH₄ and N₂O, in the associated other emissions factor set item records, you can specify values for different fuel types, such as gasoline, LPG, or biodiesel.

       

 

All individual emissions and conversion factors for sources that are not included in the electricity grid or scope 3 data types are captured as part of the Other Emissions Factors.

 

Regional Building Energy Intensity

       

 

Lookup to a building energy intensity record from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data. The CBECS is a national sample survey that collects energy usage information on commercial buildings across the USA. The energy usage data serves as a reliable and publicly available standard, and is preloaded in Net Zero Cloud. The value is automatically populated when the country is the United States, the postal code is valid, and the total floor area is populated in the record.

       

 

NTO can use the CBECS building energy intensity data to plug energy use gaps in the data of commercial buildings (more on this later).

Energy Use for Stationary Assets

 

Buildings and warehouses at NTO use electricity, diesel for backup generators, and refrigerants for cooling. Each of these require separate energy use records associated with the same stationary asset source.

 

Within energy use records, Net Zero Cloud automatically calculates many of the fields based on energy use data and emissions factors.

 

Three energy use records associated with a stationary asset environmental source record.

Data for Key Fields

 

Sam works to create the energy use records to allow for emissions calculations. He looks at the information within an energy use record, one section at a time.

 

General Information

 

On a stationary asset’s energy use record, information like the total and occupied floor area and whether the asset is company-owned helps with calculations. Sam can also specify the stationary asset for which energy consumption is being recorded, the start and end dates of the energy consumption, and the corresponding stationary asset carbon footprint record.

 

General information, such as building details, reporting period, and references to the associated asset and carbon footprint on a stationary asset energy use record.

 

Consumption

 

Depending on the type of fuel for which an energy use record is created, this section helps Sam define the following.

 

    Fuel type: There are multiple fuel types for which you can enter energy consumption, including Electricity, Diesel, Natural Gas, and Propane.

    Fuel consumption unit: Multiple units of measure are supported natively in Net Zero Cloud corresponding to the different fuel types that are supported.

 

Fuel consumption information on a stationary asset energy use record.

 

Emissions Factors

 

If the emissions factors are specified on the stationary asset environmental source, they are automatically inherited by the associated energy use records. Thanks to the flexibility of Net Zero Cloud, Sam can also override the values on each energy use record if he needs to.

 

Associated emissions factors for electricity, fuel, and refrigerants on a stationary asset energy use record.

 

Supplemental Emissions

 

Sam can also specify supplemental emissions for each scope to manually adjust emissions, if needed. These are used in the calculated total emissions.

 

Supplemental emissions information on a stationary asset energy use record.

 

Grid Mix

 

The grid mix values on the energy use record are calculated based on the grid mix percentages specified in the associated electricity emissions factor set record. If he needs to, Sam can override the values for location-based and market-based grid mix on an electricity emissions factor set record based on the information he gets from the suppliers for NTO’s buildings in a specific postal code.

 

    The market-based grid mix depends on the electricity that organizations have chosen to purchase from specific suppliers and takes supplier-specific emissions rates into consideration.

    The location-based grid mix depends on the emissions intensity of the local grid area where the electricity usage occurs.

 

Location-based and market-based grid mix information on a stationary asset energy use record.

 

Renewable Energy

 

Renewable energy displays the quantity of electricity that’s generated from renewable sources. Sam can specifically allocate electricity generated from renewable sources in the Renewable Energy Type and Allocated Renewable Energy fields. The basis for the renewable energy calculations is the allocated renewable energy value entered on the energy use record and the market-based grid mix percentage on the electricity emissions factors record.

 

Renewable energy information on a stationary asset energy use record.

 

Emissions

 

This section displays the autocalculated emissions in tCO₂e by scope corresponding to the entered energy consumption in the stationary asset energy use record.

A Few Calculations Explained

 

Now that Sam has explored the key information on an energy use record for a stationary asset, he tries to understand how the emissions are calculated. Sam creates the following energy use records for the NTO Office Headquarters Miami stationary asset environmental source record.

Calculation of Electricity Related Emissions

 

The United States - US-TX - electricityMap 2019 emissions factor record specifies the following.

 

    CO₂e Emissions Rate for Location Based Emissions Factors = 396.78 g/kWh

    Location-Based Coal-Mix Percentage: 20%

    Location-Based Gas-Mix Percentage: 47%

    Location-Based Nuclear-Mix Percentage: 11%

 

Emissions factor details on an electricity emissions factor set record.

 

Let’s see how the energy values are calculated on the stationary asset energy use record Monthly Electricity Bill Jan.

 

Scope 2 Location-Based Emissions (tCO₂e) = Electricity consumption (in kWh) * Emissions factor (g/kWh) / 10^6 (tCO₂e conversion factor)

 

                                                                       = 1000*396.78/1000000 = 0.3968 tCO₂e

 

Furthermore, here’s how the information is calculated for the Location-Based Grid Mix.

 

    Location-Based Electricity from Coal (kWh): 20% of 1000 kWh = 200 kWh

    Location-Based Electricity from Gas (kWh): 47% of 1000 kWh = 470 kWh

    Location-Based Electricity from Nuclear (kWh): 11% of 1000 kWh = 110 kWh

 

Greenhouse gas emissions results and grid mix data on a stationary asset energy use record for electricity.

 

A similar approach is followed to calculate market-based electricity emissions by referring to the market-based grid mix percentages.

 

Calculation of Diesel Related Emissions

 

The Fuel Conversion Factors - DEFRA EPA 2018 factor set record specifies the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values.

 

    GWP of CH₄: 28

    GWP of N₂O: 265

 

The OEFSI-0000006 factor set item record specifies the following.

 

Fuel Type

       

 

Calorific Value

       

 

Supplied tCO₂e Emissions Factor

       

 

CH₄ Emissions Factor

       

 

CO₂ Emissions Factor

       

 

N₂O Emissions Factor

 

Diesel

       

 

15 kWh/L

       

 

12.45 tonnes/mWh

       

 

3.00

       

 

73.96

       

 

0.06

 

The consumption of diesel (1000 Liters) is first converted to its kWh equivalent using its calorific value, which is 15 kWh/L.

 

Total Fuel Consumption = 15000 kWh (1000*15)

 

Next, this value is multiplied by the Supplied tCO₂e emissions factor and divided by the conversion factor.

 

Scope 1 Emissions (tCO₂e) = Supplied tCO₂e Emissions Factor * Total Fuel Consumption/1000

 

                                               = (12.45*15000/1000) = 186.75

 

The autocalculated Scope 1 Emissions (tCO2e) value for Diesel on a stationary asset energy use record.

 

Calculation of Refrigerant Related Emissions

 

Lastly, let’s check out how emissions are calculated when the fuel type is Refrigerant. The Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) - IPCC AR4 2007 refrigerant emissions factor record specifies the Global Warming Potential as 22,800.

 

Here’s how the emissions calculation shapes up.

 

Scope 1 Emissions (tCO₂e) = GWP * Fuel Consumption(kg)/1000

 

                                             = 22,800*10/1000 = 228

 

Greenhouse gas emission results on a stationary asset energy use record for Refrigerant.

 

In the next unit, Sam creates a carbon footprint for this stationary asset and learns more about the calculations. Let’s follow along with him.

Manage Carbon Footprint Records for Stationary Assets

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    List the key fields on stationary asset carbon footprint records.

    Explain how scope allocation is determined for various fuel sources.

    Describe how emissions are calculated for a data center.

 

Introduction to Carbon Footprints

 

Sam is making great progress! He defined emissions sources and energy uses for stationary assets and looked at how emissions are calculated in the Net Zero Cloud app. Now he concentrates on rolling up the emissions data to a carbon footprint record. Sam can attach multiple stationary asset energy use records to a stationary asset carbon footprint record to get a single calculated carbon footprint for an asset.

 

While a stationary asset carbon footprint shows the tCO₂e emissions for an asset, its child records, Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Items, show the tCO₂e emissions for individual fuel types. So, if Sam creates a carbon footprint record to calculate the total tCO₂e emissions for the NTO Headquarters for 2021, he can also have carbon footprint items that show emissions separately from, say, electricity, natural gas, and diesel.

 

Note that while Sam can manually create carbon footprint records and associate them with energy use records, the application can also do this for him. If a carbon footprint record exists for a given period, all new energy use records falling within that period get automatically associated with this carbon footprint record. If Sam creates a new energy use record and it covers a time period for which a carbon footprint record does not yet exist, Net Zero Cloud automatically creates a new carbon footprint and associates the energy record with it. This saves Sam a lot of time.

 

Note

 

Only the energy use records that Sam has created, or to which he has at least View All access, are automatically rolled up into the carbon footprint record that he creates. Sam can work with the Salesforce admin to get View All or Modify All permission for the required records.

 

When Sam attaches energy use records to a carbon footprint record, the scope 1, 2, and 3 calculations of the energy use records automatically sum to a total value shown in the carbon footprint record. Just like for individual energy use records, Sam can also manually specify supplemental emissions by scope on all carbon footprint record types.

Stationary Asset Carbon Footprints

 

The following key data points are available on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

 

General Information

 

Sam can specify the Stationary Asset Environment Source to which this footprint is associated, the reporting period of the carbon footprint, the stage of the footprint in the overall lifecycle, the previous year’s annual carbon footprint record, and the audit approval status. Sam can also select the allocation status for renewable energy used in the asset source.

 

Building Details

 

Sam can specify the building energy intensity lookup and the regional building energy intensity lookup that can be used to resolve gaps in the energy consumption data for a commercial building stationary asset (more on this in the next unit).

 

If the Stationary Asset Environmental Source record for this footprint is already associated with a Regional Building Energy Intensity record, then the same Regional Building Energy Intensity record is automatically populated in the Carbon Footprint record. However, Sam needs to identify the Building Energy Intensity record that is most applicable to the building’s carbon footprint and select that record.

 

Building Details section on a Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint record.

 

Greenhouse Gas Emissions

 

Sam can see the autocalculated values for Total Scope 1, Total Scope 2 Market-Based, Total Scope 2 Location-Based, Total Scope 3 Upstream, and Total Scope 3 Downstream Emissions (tCO₂e) for the associated source. The values are derived by summing up values from the underlying energy use records.

 

Greenhouse gas emissions results on a stationary asset Carbon footprint record.

 

Total Energy Use Summaries

 

Total Energy Consumption for the stationary asset source is calculated in kilowatt-hours, megawatt-hours, and gigajoules. Sam can also see the Total Building Indirect Energy Consumption (MWh), which is the consumption of energy specifically from electricity, heat, cooling, and steam, and excludes emissions from other fuels.

Renewable Energy Details

 

Based on the allocation status of the carbon footprint, Sam can see the Total Renewable Energy generated, both in absolute kWh and as a percentage of the overall electricity consumed. Also, he can see allocated renewable energy expressed in kWh, which is the renewable energy explicitly defined in energy use records. Sam can refer to these values to check the proportion of renewable or “cleaner” sources of energy used for each asset. This positions him better to meet his goal of increasing the allocated renewable energy percentage.

Grid Mix Information

 

Sam can see the rolled up values from all electricity energy use records for both location-based and market-based grid mix data for the asset source. And just like for energy use records, the data is categorized by fuel sources, such as biomass, coal, solar, wind, and oil. This makes it easy for Sam to see the big picture but also hone in on the fuel source components and how they each play a role.

 

Location-based and market-based grid mix data on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

 

Energy Use Intensity Comparisons

 

Sam can see the total regional electricity consumption intensity and the percentage difference between the regional intensity and the intensity of the associated carbon footprint item for electricity consumption. Sam can use this information to understand how far off a particular stationary asset is from the average electricity consumption in that region. If the variance is too high, maybe it’s time to make the building more energy-efficient.

Data Quality Metrics

 

Sam can view the average monthly electricity consumption and the energy consumption intensities for the current and previous years, calculated both in square meters and square feet. Another handy value is to check the maximum variance above and below the average expressed as a percentage. This is super useful for Sam to understand the role seasonality plays and to identify any data abnormalities.

Footprint Items

 

The Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Items for a Carbon Footprint contain data for an individual fuel type. Let’s take the example from the previous unit to see a snapshot of how data rolls up in Net Zero Cloud.

 

Three carbon footprint items, each for a different fuel type, associated with a parent carbon footprint for a stationary asset.

 

Here’s a way to see how carbon footprint items roll up data based on fuel type, and how carbon footprints roll up data based on consolidated energy consumption across all fuel types.

The following key information can be found on a stationary asset carbon footprint item record.

 

    Total Emissions (tCO₂e) from the fuel type.

    Total Energy Consumption of the Fuel Type, expressed in kWh equivalent, even if the underlying fuel is not electricity.

    Energy Consumption Intensity of the Fuel Type for the current and previous years.

 

Intensity metrics on a stationary asset carbon footprint item record, where fuel type is electricity.

What’s the Scope?

 

For each energy consumption record entered, there is a default scope against which the emissions are recorded based on the fuel type and asset ownership. The asset ownership is determined by the Company-Owned Asset checkbox on an asset’s record. The associated energy use records inherit this status from the asset, but it can also be overridden.

 

To understand the default scope allocation performed by Net Zero Cloud for various fuel types and for assets owned and leased by the reporting company, check out Stationary Asset Energy Use.

 

There are typical allocations based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance, but exceptions occur frequently in the world of carbon accounting. There can be instances where Sam needs to change the default scope allocation for a specific asset source. For example, NTO might own the building, and therefore consider most fuels to be scope 1, while leasing equipment and considering emissions from that equipment to be scope 3. These determinations are often made with the help of experienced consultants.

 

The default scope allocations in Net Zero Cloud can be overridden through the Scope Allocation capability, where Sam can assign the scope into which a particular fuel type’s emissions must be aggregated. To do this, he creates a new carbon emissions scope allocation record, manually sets each individual fuel’s allocation to a scope in the child records, and then assigns the new carbon emissions scope allocation record to his asset. By using Scope Allocation, Net Zero Cloud users have ultimate flexibility in how they account for their GHG emissions.

Data Centers as Asset Sources

 

NTO, being a retail company, doesn’t operate any data centers. But there are companies who do, and they must define their data centers as stationary asset environmental sources. The reason that data centers are considered a special case in Net Zero Cloud is because of the way total electricity usage in the facility is estimated from known electricity consumption of the IT equipment.

 

A Salesforce admin can configure the record type for the asset and information can be captured for data centers, similar to commercial buildings. While most calculations are similar for emissions, there are two major differences.

 

    If the fuel type on a stationary asset energy use record is Electricity for a data center asset source, the user must specify a value for the field Power Usage Effectiveness. Generally a value between 1 and 2, this is the ratio of the total amount of energy used by a data center to the energy delivered to just the computing equipment. The calculated emissions are scaled up by this value to calculate tCO₂e for electricity. For other fuel types, there are no changes to calculated emissions.

    The Power Usage Effectiveness field on a stationary asset energy use record for a data center.

    Therefore, for data center assets, Total Fuel Consumption (kWh) = Fuel Consumption (kWh) * Power Usage Effectiveness

    In the other emissions factor set, there’s a provision to show the Data Center Refrigerant Leakage Rate value expressed in kg/IT kWh, which specifies the leakage rate of the refrigerant used for cooling the data center's computing equipment.

Sam has explored carbon accounting for stationary assets and learned about the calculations. In the next unit, let’s follow along as Sam uses Net Zero Cloud to fill gaps in the carbon footprint data.

Benchmark Building Energy Intensity and Fill Gaps in the Carbon Footprint Data

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    List the possible data gaps in a carbon footprint record.

    Explain building benchmarks.

    List the steps to fill gaps in a carbon footprint record.

 

No Data, No Worries!

 

NTO has many buildings across the globe. The company uses several energy sources to heat and cool the buildings, and power gadgets and devices. As we saw in the earlier unit, Net Zero Cloud uses energy use records to calculate the carbon footprint. Sam uses the monthly utility bills to obtain the energy consumption data for these assets, which he then feeds into Net Zero Cloud as energy use records.

 

But there’s a problem. Electricity bills for a couple of months for a few of NTO’s buildings aren’t available. And there’s no way for Sam to know the total energy usage for these months.

 

Any gaps in the energy use data can cause inaccurate carbon footprint accounting, which can lead to incorrect annual emissions inventories. We can’t stress enough the need for reliable and auditable carbon inventories for accurate sustainability impact reporting.

 

Here’s a list of situations that can cause gaps in the energy use data.

 

    Missing energy consumption data: The monthly energy consumption bills are missing or the data is unavailable for some reason.

    Orphan energy use records: Energy use records that share the reporting year and organization asset with a carbon footprint (CF) record but aren’t linked to the CF record yet.

    Date issues: Two or more energy use records cover the same reporting period but have issues with dates. For example, missing start or end dates, start or end dates being out of range over the same reporting period, or overlapping start and end dates.

 

So what should Sam do? Fortunately, Net Zero Cloud provides a quick and easy way to intelligently identify gaps in the carbon footprint data and fill them. Sam can use industry benchmarks or create custom benchmarks.

 

Note

 

Data gap filling is available only for stationary assets with the Commercial Building record type. As part of the initial configuration for stationary assets, the Salesforce admin creates the Commercial Building record type. (To learn more about the admin setup, see the Net Zero Cloud Admin Essentials Trailhead module.)

Benchmark Your Building Energy Usage

 

Net Zero Cloud supports the use of the following benchmarking approaches to fill in the missing energy use data.

 

Use Industry Benchmark

 

The Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) is a national sample survey that researches and collects energy-related building characteristics and energy usage data of U.S. commercial buildings. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes CBECS results.

 

For reference data, the Salesforce admin loads the CBECS industry benchmark data into Regional Building Energy Intensity data records.

 

Create and Use Your Own Benchmark

 

Sam can use BEI Builder in Net Zero Cloud to compute a benchmark and develop insights into the average energy usage across all NTO buildings. Sam can then use the benchmark for filling in the gaps for buildings with missing energy use data. These numbers are stored in Building Energy Intensity (BEI) data records. BEI is measured in kWh/sqft or kWh/m² per year.

Create a Building Energy Intensity Record Using BEI Builder

 

BEI Builder guides Sam through the process of creating BEI records for NTO’s commercial buildings. It calculates the benchmark by averaging energy consumption values from existing energy use records.

 

 

 

Note

 

Only energy use records that Sam has created, or to which he has at least View All access, are automatically pulled into the BEI record that Sam creates. Sam can work with the Salesforce admin to get View All or Modify All permission for all the required records.

 

Energy use records that meet certain filter criteria are considered for BEI calculation. Let’s go over these criteria.

 

Averaging Window Start Date and Averaging Window End Date

 

Energy use records must belong to the period defined by these dates.

 

Building Size Category

 

Energy use records must be for assets whose total floor area falls in the range defined by the building size category record. For more information, see Create a Building Size Category record.

 

 

 

Note

 

BEI Builder uses the occupied floor area of buildings to calculate the BEI to ensure that usage is estimated for the occupied space in which the energy was consumed.

 

The floor area values are retrieved from the corresponding stationary asset environmental source record for the asset.

 

 

 

Building Asset Type

 

The buildings must be of the asset type defined by Building Asset Type. Asset types can be Office, Restaurant, or Hotel.

 

Note

 

Ensure that the record type for the asset is mapped with the stationary asset type - Commercial Building.

 

GeographicalArea

 

The buildings must be from the business region or country defined by Geographical Area.

 

Energy consumption of buildings can vary depending on the climate and other external factors that are specific to a geographical area. Hence, geographical area information plays a key role in creating a distinct benchmark that’s used for data gap filling.

 

If Sam wants to include energy use records that are created during the data gap filling process, he can select the System Generated Energy Use Records Included checkbox.

 

On clicking Create, the Calculate Building Energy Intensity data processing job runs in the backend to calculate BEI and create a record. The Salesforce admin has already activated this data processing engine job template. For more information about BEI calculations, see Building Energy Intensity Calculations.

Using CBECS vs BEI

 

Whether you use the industry benchmark (CBECS) data or your own benchmark for filling data gaps depends on your organization’s requirements and preferences. For example, organizations can choose CBECS for buildings in the USA as it’s reliable and has been validated by government agencies. If CBECS data isn’t available for a certain fuel type or region, or the organization wants to use its own benchmark, you’d go with BEI.

 

Let’s follow along as Sam uses Net Zero Cloud to identify and fill data gaps in one of the CF records.

Fill Data Gaps in Carbon Accounting with Net Zero Cloud

 

To get started, Sam selects Fill Data Gaps from the action menu of a carbon footprint record, which launches a wizard. Data gap filling in Net Zero Cloud is a three-step process.

 

 

 

Step 1. Associate the orphan energy use records with the carbon footprint record.

 

The first page lists energy use records that match the reporting year and organization asset of the CF record but aren’t yet associated with this or any other CF record.

 

 

 

Sam reviews the list, selects the ones that must be associated with the CF record, and clicks Save. The selected records get associated with the CF record and are removed from the list.

 

Note

 

Only the energy use records that Sam has created, or to which he has at least View All access, are displayed in the list.

 

Sam clicks Next to move to the next step.

 

Step 2. Fix energy use report dates.

 

The next page lists energy use records that are associated with the CF record but have issues with dates.

 

 

 

By default, the list shows all such records but Sam can choose to view records with specific issues only. For example, to view records with missing dates, Sam keeps only the Missing dates checkbox selected and clicks Search to refresh the list.

 

Sam fixes the dates and clicks Save, and then clicks Next to move to the final step.

 

Step 3. For fuel types with missing energy use data, create and associate energy use records.

 

Steps 1 and 2 helped Sam identify and associate unassociated energy use records with the CF record, and correct date issues in associated energy use records. The final step is to fill the data gaps.

 

Sam must select the fuel type for which he wants to fill the data gaps, and the fill method. He selects Cooling for the fuel type and Regional Building Energy Intensity for the fill method. The page shows record entries for the period with missing data and suggested values in the Fill Data (kWh) column.

 

 

 

In the case of Regional Building Energy Intensity fill method, Net Zero Cloud uses the intensity value from the preloaded CBECS data.

 

This fill method is available only if a Regional BEI record is associated with the CF record (Regional Building Energy Intensity field).

 

Record entries on the page provide details of the energy use records that will be automatically created. Sam selects the desired entries per fuel type and saves the changes before clicking Finish.

 

The corresponding energy use records are created. Sam notices that the System Generated Record checkbox in the Data Gap Filling Audit Information section of each of these records is selected.

 

 

 

Likewise, Sam reviews, identifies, and fixes data gaps and inconsistencies in other CF records.

 

Let’s see how Net Zero Cloud calculates the suggested values when we select other fill methods.

 

Building Energy Intensity: Net Zero Cloud uses the intensity value that Sam created using BEI Builder.

 

This method is available only if a BEI record is associated with the CF record (Building Energy Intensity field).

 

Previous Year Daily Average: Net Zero Cloud computes and uses the average daily energy consumption data from the previous year. This method is available only if the previous year’s CF record is associated with the Previous Year Annual Carbon Footprint field in the CF record, and if at least one energy use record for the selected fuel type exists.

 

 

 

Current Year Daily Average: Net Zero Cloud computes and uses the average daily energy consumption data from the current year. This method is available only if at least one energy use record for the selected fuel type exists.

 

Manual: Sam must enter the energy use data for filling the gap manually.

 

 

 

Sam is now ready to see how carbon accounting works for vehicle assets. Let’s find out in the next unit.

Track Carbon Emissions for Vehicle Asset Sources

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    List the key fields on vehicle asset records.

    List the key fields on vehicle asset energy use records.

    Explain how to calculate emissions from vehicle assets.

 

NTO’s Vehicle Assets

 

NTO has two key vehicle emissions sources to account for: the private jets that NTO operates and the shuttle cars that are used for employee commuting. Sam creates a company-owned asset for a private jet used by the CEO of the company, and a record for the company shuttle in the Miami region, which they lease from a local car rental company for employee commutes.

 

While most fields remain similar for the vehicle emissions sources, Sam takes a look at the key fields that impact emissions calculations.

 

    Vehicle type: Based on the record types configured by the admin, you can select the type of vehicle for which you want to calculate emissions. NTO can select between Fleet Vehicles and Private Jets.

    Other emissions factors: Lookup to the object that holds reference data for emissions from various fuel sources. Other emissions factor item records associated with the parent other emissions factor set record contains emissions factors for different fuel types, such as jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, or CNG.

 

Apart from these key fields, Sam can also add additional information, such as the scope allocation, lease ID, lease expiration date, vehicle ID, and business region on a vehicle asset emissions source record.

 

A Vehicle Asset Emissions Source record showing details of NTO Miami Company Shuttle.

Energy Use Records for Vehicle Assets

 

Let’s turn our attention to energy use. Now that he’s recorded his vehicle assets, Sam can specify supplier-provided fuel consumption data. Here are the details that Sam can specify on the energy use record.

 

    Fuel consumption details: Depending on the type of asset, fuel type can either be jet fuel for private jets, or any other fuel for fleet vehicles, such as biodiesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), diesel, or gasoline. Sam can also specify fuel consumption values in liters or gallons from gas station bills and fuel refill receipts.

    Distance: This is the distance traveled by a company car or the private jet for the reporting period. Distance can be specified in kilometers or miles.

    Aircraft details: Sam can specify the type of aircraft, which impacts the fuel efficiency and consumption patterns. From the flight receipts, Sam can also specify the flight duration and flight date.

 

The following attributes are auto calculated based on the values provided and the data that is in an emissions factor record linked to.

 

    Fuel Efficiency

    CH₄, CO₂, and N₂O Emissions (kg)

    Scope-Based Emissions (tCO₂e)

    Total Fuel Consumption in US Gallons and Liters

    Aircraft Fuel Economy (Gallons per Hour)

 

User-specified and autocalculated fields on a vehicle asset energy use record.

Vehicle Asset Carbon Footprint

 

Now it’s time for Sam to create a carbon footprint record for each vehicle asset that he’d specified earlier to calculate the total carbon emissions from a vehicle represented in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e). The conversion factors from the associated Other Emissions Factors and related Other Emissions Factor Items are used to calculate the emissions.

 

The following key data points are available on a vehicle asset carbon footprint record.

 

    Total fuel use: Sam can view the total fuel usage for a vehicle in gallons and in liters. The values are rolled up from the associated energy use records for the vehicle.

    Supplemental emissions: Sam can also specify supplemental emissions by scope to manually adjust emissions, if needed. These are added to the calculated total emissions.

    Greenhouse gas emissions: Sam can see the auto calculated values for Total Scope 1, Total Scope 2 Market-Based, Total Scope 2 Location-Based, Total Scope 3 Upstream and Total Scope 3 Downstream Emissions (tCO₂e) for the associated source.

Fuel Consumption

       

 

100 liters

 

The data inputs on a vehicle asset energy use record.

 

First, Net Zero Cloud converts the fuel consumption to gallons. 100 liters = 26.42 gallons.

 

Next, let’s look at the information in the  other emissions factor set record. The fuel conversion factors - DEFRA EPA 2018 record has an associated other emissions factor item record that holds the emissions factors for Diesel. The values are as follows.

 

Field

       

 

 Value

 

CO₂ Emissions Factor

       

 

9.75 g/US gal

 

N₂O Emissions Factor

       

 

0.3 g/US gal

 

CH₄ Emissions Factor

       

 

0.12 g/US gal

 

So, for 26.4 gallons of Diesel, the mass of CO₂, N₂O, and CH₄ generated is calculated by applying the emissions factors.

 

    CO2: 26.42*9.75*0.001 = 0.257568 kg

    N20: 26.4*0.3*0.001 = 0.007925 kg

    CH4: 26.4*0.12*0.001 = 0.003170 kg

 

Note that the contribution of N₂O and CH₄ emissions in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents is not 1:1. This equivalence is obtained from the global warming potential (GWP) values referred to in the other emissions factors record.

 

    N₂O GWP = 265

    CH₄ GWP = 28

 

Scope 1 Emissions (tCO₂e) = {CO₂ Emissions (Kg) /1000} + {N₂O Emissions (Kg) /1000 *N₂O GWP} + {CH₄ Emissions (Kg)/1000 * CH₄ GWP}

 

                                             = {0.257568/1000} + {0.007925/1000*265} + {0.003170/1000*28} = 0.0024

Similar calculations are carried out for private jets by referring to the fuel conversion factors for jet fuel and other values, such as aircraft fuel economy.

What’s Next?

 

Let’s pause for a moment to understand what Sam has done so far. He has listed the stationary and vehicle asset sources for NTO’s carbon accounting process and he has decoded the various emissions factors used for estimation of tCO₂e emissions for these assets. Next, he has created energy use records for stationary and vehicle assets, and he created the required carbon footprint records to aggregate the data. Sam has also looked at the calculations behind the scenes. He is now ready to uncover a few extra details about the carbon accounting process in the next unit.

Explore Additional Features for Carbon Accounting

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    List the stages of carbon footprints.

    Explain record locking and carbon footprint recalculation.

    Explain why you need an annual carbon inventory record.

 

Carbon Footprint Stages

 

A carbon footprint record is flexible in Net Zero Cloud. Companies can choose the reporting period for carbon footprints and how granular they want footprints to be. For example, Sam has the flexibility to create carbon footprint records that summarize emissions for a single asset for a given year, or for multiple assets across any period. NTO has chosen to create carbon footprints for each stationary and vehicle asset source for a single year.

 

Sam notices that on all carbon footprint records there’s a field called the Footprint Stage. Carbon footprints for NTO go through a detailed process of approval and audit. All data is validated within Sam’s team and calculations are completed. Then, both internal and external audits are conducted to ensure that all emissions are correctly accounted for.

 

Net Zero Cloud makes this process easy to manage. The Footprint Stage field comes with logical values that help Sam move the record through each stage with a simple click! Let’s take a closer look at these values and what they mean.

 

Note

 

The following picklist values are available by default for the Footprint Stage field on a carbon footprint record in Net Zero Cloud, but your admin can customize the stages as per company requirements.

 

    Emissions source confirmation: The user confirms whether to include an individual building or vehicle asset in the carbon footprint.

    Data collection: All energy consumption records are entered and associated with the assets.

    Validation: The user determines that the initial data looks correct, including the input and the calculated emissions output based on the associated emissions factors.

    Renewable energy allocation: The renewable energy allocation information is added to the energy consumption records.

    Internal audit: An internal auditor validates the energy consumption and carbon footprint information.

    External audit: An external auditor validates the carbon footprint information.

    Completed: The validated carbon footprint record is marked as complete.

 

The Footprint Stage picklist on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

 

The best part is that Sam can easily manage multiple carbon footprint records through their lifecycle using the Kanban view. This view makes the workflow better because Sam can visually track where each record is in the footprinting process. And when one stage is complete, he simply drags the record and drops it to the column of the next stage!

 

The Kanban view of carbon footprint records in different footprint stages.

Do More with Carbon Footprints

 

The flexibility doesn’t end there. Sam explores a few additional features that make carbon accounting even easier with Net Zero Cloud.

 

Lock the Carbon Footprint Record

 

To ensure that the carbon footprint record is not updated accidentally or by an automated process, Sam locks the carbon footprint record, which also locks the child, or associated, energy use records. This prevents the carbon footprint record and all the energy use records associated with it from being recalculated. It also prevents accidental updates to the records during audits. Locked carbon footprint records can be unlocked later.

Recalculate the Carbon Footprint

 

The carbon footprint record can become out of sync with the energy use records that are associated with it, such as when emissions factors change or when the energy consumption numbers are updated in a child energy use record. If the emissions factors have changed for any associated energy use records, Sam can click Recalculate on a carbon footprint to reset and recalculate values from all attached energy use records. When a child energy use record is added or updated, Net Zero Cloud automatically recalculates all the child energy use records and the carbon footprint record. No manual updating and tracking needed!

Note

 

Sam can modify, lock, unlock, and recalculate carbon footprint records that he created. But if he wants to perform these actions on records that are created by other users, he must have Modify All permission on them. Sam can work with the Salesforce admin to gain the required permissions.

Why Do You Need a Carbon Inventory?

 

Sam now understands all the essentials of carbon accounting. Since all the work’s done and it’s the end of the year, Sam wants to give himself a pat on the back and a well-deserved break. But before that, he notices that there’s one last item left to be ticked off his to-do list. Sam can create an annual emissions inventory record for any given year to roll up all carbon footprints for all sources and activities. The aim for NTO is to set a science-based target and develop an emissions reduction target in line with Science-Based Targets Initiative’s (SBTi) criteria. The carbon inventory is the first step towards getting started on that path.

 

On an annual emissions inventory record, Sam can see granular information for each emissions source type, broken up by category and activity and even the percentage of each emissions type towards the total emissions. Emissions from a Carbon Footprint record are aggregated into the annual emissions inventory if they meet the following conditions:

 

    The Reporting Year on a footprint record matches the Year that is selected during inventory creation.

    The Footprint Stage on a footprint record matches the Carbon Footprint Stage that is selected during inventory creation.

    The Annual Emissions Inventory on a footprint record is associated with an inventory record.

 

An annual emissions inventory record for 2021 showing total emissions by scope.

 

Previously, Sam would have had to do all these calculations manually. That could have taken months! Salesforce Net Zero Cloud enables easy recording and traceability of calculated emissions. Moreover, Sam can also use this data to further forecast NTO’s emissions for upcoming years accurately. Sam can truly have a restful time-off!

Sum It Up

 

Salesforce Net Zero Cloud solves many of the issues with traditional carbon accounting: incomplete or missing records, manual data tracking in multiple spreadsheets, and unstructured data. The time it took NTO to collect, calculate, and audit data has been reduced from months to weeks.

 

With all the data flowing directly onto one platform, Sam can efficiently quantify the carbon footprint across scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and reduce NTO’s carbon footprint, getting them closer to their net zero goal. Following in his footsteps, you too can formulate a climate action plan from a single source of truth, and easily measure and manage your plans with your trusted partner, the Net Zero Cloud.

Learn About Digital Engagement

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Explain what digital engagement is.

    Describe key benefits of digital customer service.

    Identify the differences between digital service and digital transformation.

 

What Is Digital Engagement?

 

Ursa Major Solar’s business continues to grow. The company can’t keep enough solar panels in stock to sell to all its customers—and potential customers—who keep trying to contact them. But contacting Ursa Major Solar is difficult. At least that’s what Sita Nagappan-Alvarez, the CEO of Ursa Major Solar, keeps hearing. After a large deal closed with a residential builder, the client said, “If I could’ve reached you or learned about your business sooner, I would’ve bought twice as many panels...”

 

Salesforce Research states, "As customers spend more time at home with their devices and less time in stores or places of work, the shift toward digital channels has accelerated. At the same time, the share of organizations offering in-person customer service plummeted, and channels such as online chat, messenger apps, and video support saw double-digit adoption gains. Eighty-seven percent of service professionals say customers have increased their use of digital channels during the pandemic." Gone are the days when an email or phone call is enough. To keep customers and potential customers happy, you must engage with them in the digital realm.

 

Enter, digital engagement. It’s a term that describes how companies engage with customers across all digital touchpoints, while providing a consistent customer experience. Typically, a customer’s journey includes marketing, selling, and servicing in a way that lets them switch between multiple channels without interrupting a positive experience.

A typical digital customer journey for Ursa Major Solar might look like this:

 

    A new campaign to promote solar panels on the web or on multiple social media channels (Marketing Cloud Engagement).

    Leads and opportunities from the campaign are captured and every stage of the deal is tracked and analyzed until the sale of the solar panel is complete (Sales Cloud & Commerce Cloud).

    After the solar panel is purchased, customers receive service reminders as texts on their mobile devices, review service agreements from a website, and reach out to support via chatbots, web chat, social media channels, and more (Service Cloud).

 

Each part of the journey—no matter where the customer is at—is optimized with automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to make sure that a positive experience is delivered consistently.

Digital Transformation

 

Sita knows that emerging technology is transforming customers’ expectations. Customers ask virtual assistants to play their morning playlist, use applications to order their favorite foods, call for a ride, or navigate traffic. The reason these experiences are sticky is that emerging technologies like AI are embedded into these apps to power customer experiences. To stay competitive, companies need to incorporate digital technologies into their customer experiences.

 

Customers expect to interact with businesses the same way they do in their personal lives—on mobile devices, with SMS messaging, social media, and more. If customers aren’t receiving the experiences they expect, they can easily take their business elsewhere. The rise of social media and review websites give customers more of a voice. In the past, customers might have shared a bad experience with friends and family, but with social media, they can broadcast bad experiences with the world.

 

Digital transformation—converting ink-on-paper records to digital formats—encourages businesses to reconsider how to deliver customer experiences, and question traditional ideas of teams and departments. That doesn’t mean support agents need to run marketing campaigns, but it can mean knocking down walls between departments. A social media presence can encompass marketing, selling, and servicing, tied together by a digital platform that captures customer information, creates personalized journeys, and routes questions from customers or potential customers to the right support agents.

Benefits of Digital Service

 

Sita knows that digital transformation has reshaped how companies approach customer service. The old model was to wait for customers to find you, whether in person or by calling a toll-free number. But the rise of digital communication has changed service much like it’s changed advertising, media, and news.

 

The practice of providing excellent service hasn’t changed. But the process of answering a question, looking up relevant data, and offering a solution has become much more efficient with mobile devices and multiple communication channels. Sita can see that embracing social media, automation, and AI will help build better relationships with new and existing customers.

 

Benefit

       

 

Description

 

Unify data and systems across teams for faster resolution

       

 

    Get a sense of the customer’s state of mind and provide a better experience by giving both sales and service a 360-degree view of each customer.

    Know when the customer is having service issues before sales pitches to them so that all factors are considered before important negotiations.

    Prepare deals to move forward by having the service team prioritize resolving the customer’s issues while sales works with them.

 

Help customers help themselves with self-service options

       

 

    Empower customers to serve themselves at their convenience, 24/7.

    Let customers do almost everything in a web portal that support agents can accomplish in a contact center. Customers will gain a sense of control when they have anytime access to answers, account information, and the ability to make updates, additions, or changes.

    Make self-service easier by dedicating space on a mobile-ready website, a mobile application, or even a stand-alone mobile app.

 

Collaborate and share sources of truth with sites

       

 

    Take part in the conversations about your brand. Host an online portal where customers and potential customers can find trustworthy answers to their questions, collaborate with experts, and voice issues to which support agents can respond.

    Make social media and your site complementary by promoting your site in social feeds and bringing questions from social feeds into your site.

    Allow support agents to monitor and respond to social media channels like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube so service is available wherever customers spend time online.

 

Add faster alternatives to voice calls with SMS, messaging, and chat

       

 

    Give your customers an alternative to voice calls by supporting one-to-one service conversations across multiple messaging and chat channels.

    Offer customers the convenience of using messaging apps to communicate with your business, just like how they communicate with friends and family. Add SMS to your toll-free business number for messaging to appeal to mobile customers.

    Add a seamless support agent hand off by replacing static pre-chat forms with a simple chatbot experience to gather basic information from your customers. Or offer a chat experience directly from your mobile app.

 

Free up agents with automation and AI to deliver better service

       

 

    Identify areas where your customers and support agents spend the most time on repetitive tasks. Then, apply the power of automation and AI to deliver smarter experiences, which free up agents to solve bigger problems.

    Embed automation into service workflows with action lists and step-by-step guidance to make processes faster.

    Use AI to route work to the right agent, prefill case context, and make recommendations for next actions based on machine learning from past cases.

 

 

Sita knows that she must move Ursa Major Solar into the realm of digital service. Based on the State of Service report from Salesforce, she understands that she’s not alone: 81% of decision-makers say they’re accelerating digital initiatives. But where to start? Enter Service Cloud.

    Explain how Service Cloud helps with digital engagement.

    Describe key digital engagement options with Service Cloud.

 

How Service Cloud Helps with Digital Engagement

 

Even though each digital engagement journey for a customer includes marketing, selling, and servicing, Sita focuses on service. Based on the stats and feedback she’s received, transforming service for Ursa Major Solar is her number one priority.

 

Tip: This module focuses on digital engagement for Service Cloud. To learn more about the other clouds, see:

First, since Salesforce is already in use, a number of digital engagement tools are available to set up. Maria may need to purchase a few new user or feature licenses, but everything she needs to help Ursa Major Solar engage and support customers in the digital realm is a few clicks away.

 

Service Area

       

 

Description

 

Service Cloud Platform

       

 

    Provide a 360-degree view of customers and their past preferences from multiple channels. The platform includes agent productivity tools and routing features so customer cases automatically go to the right agent, at the right time, from anywhere, on any device.

    Push agents relevant knowledge from across your organization, including key articles, topics, and advice from your product experts.

    Allow agents to see customers’ histories to check on service agreements and to offer personalized incentives and special offers.

 

Service Cloud Messaging

       

 

    Let your company have conversations with customers in ways that are most convenient for them—on their mobile devices using messaging apps, such as SMS text messaging and Facebook Messenger.

    Power conversations with chatbots to automate service or agents can connect instantly with a customer to give them the personalized help they might need.

 

Service Cloud Embedded Service for Web or Mobile Apps

       

 

    Embed customer service directly into your web pages and mobile apps so you can reach customers right where they are.

    Let your customers contact you on the go without interrupting their browsing experience or mobile experience.

    Add chat, knowledge, and case capabilities to your websites and mobile apps to provide richer service.

 

Salesforce Self-Service

       

 

    Build branded sites that let customers help themselves, anytime, on any device, without the assistance of an agent.

    Add self-service web portals to help customers connect with each other for insights, access knowledge, and interact with chatbots to find the right resources or get redirected to the right agent for immediate service.

 

Service Cloud Einstein

       

 

    Put artificial intelligence (AI) into routine service interactions, especially for chatbots on digital channels like web chat, SMS messaging, or voice activated devices.

    Connect chatbots to existing business process for more intelligent service automation.

    Save agents time by using machine learning to surface the best responses and knowledge from past cases and conversations. Let Einstein analyze incoming cases to automatically predict fields so that the right agents can handle specific requests faster.

 

 

Sita is impressed with Service Cloud’s areas to support the digital realm. But she wonders where email and phone fits in. “Aren’t email and phones digital?” Maria assures her that email and telephone are traditional channels for service that often fall into the realm of digital engagement. Both email and telephony are part of multichannel service available with Service Cloud.

Digital Engagement Options with Service Cloud

 

Maria dives a little deeper into specific Service Cloud features and how they help with customer engagement. Learning about these features will help Sita and the service team decide what to implement.

 

Service Area

       

 

Description

 

Service Console

       

 

    The Service Console is a centralized interface that lets agents see all relevant information about customers and helps them respond to cases across multiple channels, simultaneously.

    The console integrates with productivity tools, routing mechanisms, useful knowledge, predictive intelligence, data from other systems, and more to provide a unified workspace to support customers on any device, from any location, across any channel.

    All service features and channels connect with the console. And, since the console is a Lightning app, it’s easy to customize and scale with components and drag-and-drop tools.

 

Salesforce Mobile app

       

 

    Salesforce Mobile app is for customer service on the go, and it’s available on both iOS and Android devices.

    The app gives you real-time access to the same case and customer information that you see on the console but is organized for getting work done from your mobile device.

 

Omni-Channel

       

 

    Omni-Channel routes any type of incoming work item to the most qualified, available support agents in the console. Monitor agent workloads and the status of work items routed by Omni-Channel.

    Agents can raise flags on work items when they need assistance from a supervisor, and supervisors can monitor conversations between agents and customers, and send helpful messages that only the agent sees.

    Supervisors can also respond to incoming support requests by changing queues as needed and can update agent skills quickly.

 

Voice & Call Center

       

 

    Voice & Call Center integrates phone call capabilities with the console so that you can use your computer as a phone. Whenever a customer calls, their information appears front and center for agents so that they have everything they need to help the customer.

    No more time spent searching, scrolling, or clicking for information about a customer. Make outgoing calls directly from the console, and report on call outcome, duration, and more.

 

Email-to-Case

       

 

    Email-to-Case automatically converts emails sent to an address you specify to cases in the console.

    Email exchanges between customers and agents are tracked to see history and sentiment and lead to the quickest resolution.

 

Web-to-Case

       

 

    Web-to-Case lets you add a submission form on your website so that customers can submit cases directly to the console for agents.

    Since you choose the case fields on the form, any workflows, assignments, and responses are automatically triggered.

 

Experience Cloud Sites

       

 

    Sites help you share information and collaborate with customers, partners, or employees. Whether you call it a self-service web portal, a help forum, a support site, or something else, an online community lets your agents share approved content and connect with others from the console.

    Use easy point-and-click tools with Lightning templates to create branded collaboration spaces for various business purposes.

 

Messaging

       

 

    Messaging lets customers start conversations with your company by sending texts to your designated phone number or sending Facebook Messenger messages to your Facebook page. Incoming messages are displayed in the console, where agents can accept messages and start chatting.

    Agents can also proactively reach out to customers on these channels to keep them updated or use automation to send customers messages when Salesforce records change, such as when cases are closed.

 

Embedded Service

       

 

    Embedded Service helps you add personalized service to connected apps for mobile and the web. Create and monitor cases from any mobile device for a seamless service experience wherever your customers are located.

    Set up two-way audio chat for devices so that agents can have context for issues and solve problems directly from the console.

 

Einstein Bots

       

 

    Einstein Bots are applications that simulate human conversation, either aloud or from text message. Instead of having a conversation with an agent, customers can have a conversation with a computer integrated with an AI technology called Natural Language Understanding (NLU).

    Whether through typing or talking, a chatbot can connect with a customer to answer routine questions, leaving agents more time to help customers with more complex questions or problems.

 

Einstein Case Classification

       

 

    Einstein Case Classification uses predictive intelligence on new cases to recommend or populate picklist and checkbox field values based on past data. It uses machine learning, AI technology that determines the values on case fields, to free up time for support agents.

    More time for support agents means more time spent making customers happy and delivering exceptional experiences.

 

 

A Service Console integrated with multiple channels alongside the Salesforce Mobile app.

 

 

Now that Sita has a better idea of what digital service options are available with Service Cloud, she asks Maria to help her start planning for digital engagement.

Plan for Digital Engagement

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Learn the importance of implementing case management before digital engagement.

    Begin the planning process for Service Cloud’s digital engagement tools.

    Understand the importance of content for digital engagement.

 

Prepare for Digital Service

 

Maria knows that adding multiple channels is the second stage of the general setup process for Service Cloud. (See the Service Cloud for Lightning Experience module for a refresher.)

 

Service Cloud’s implementation process represented by concentric circles with an arrow pointed at the second circle, which is Channels.

 

Maria understands why she shouldn’t set up channels or digital engagement first: If a customer reaches out for help, but there’s no consistent way to track, route, or respond to their question, who would receive the case to resolve? A customer or agent lost in an unclear case management process makes for an unhappy customer and agent.

 

Maria is excited about setting up digital engagement features for service. Before she sets up any features, she asks Ursa Major Solar’s service team some questions about how they work. She wants a thousand-foot view into their general processes and requirements before she implements any specific features.

 

Fundamentals

 

Question

       

 

Answer

 

Do your agents have a complete view of the customer?

       

 

Yes, during our case management implementation, we customized a Service Console to show account, contact, and other records for 360-degree views of customers. The console is ready to support multiple channels.

 

Are you able to effectively route cases or messaging sessions to the right agents?

       

 

Yes, during our case management implementation, we set up some queues, assignment rules, and escalation rules, but we need to look into Omni-Channel.

 

Omni-Channel routing sounds more robust and can automatically push and prioritize a variety of work to agents, without them picking items from a queue or determining priorities. We definitely need Omni-Channel for better automation and to scale the growth of our service team.

 

Are you using automation to save time and speed case resolution?

       

 

We’re using some of the basic assignment and escalation rules.

 

However, we’re not using anything like automated conversations with chatbots to answer routine questions online. We’re also not using any kind of AI or machine learning to make automatic field predictions to speed up case resolution. Someone needs to look into self-service, Einstein Bots, and Einstein Case Classification.

 

Do your agents spend a significant amount of time switching between applications to get customer information or answers?

       

 

The console has made it easier for agents to see complete views of customers, but we need to do something about knowledge.

 

We implemented Salesforce Knowledge, but we need to add the Knowledge component to the console so that automation suggests correct answers to agents while they’re working on cases.

 

Self-Service

 

Question

       

 

Answer

 

Where can customers find answers to questions about your products or services? Can they access answers and information on a website or a mobile app?

       

 

Currently, we have a Web-to-Case form on our website where customers can submit cases. But that’s it. We’ve been wanting to update our website for a while, but we haven’t made the time.

 

After reading about Experience Cloud sites, we need something like that online where customers, agents, and experts can collaborate and share ideas. We also need a source of truth for some documents about our solar panels. And adding a chatbot on an Experience Cloud site to answer common questions would help unload some of the most tedious work from our agents.

 

Information for customers on a mobile app sounds great, but we need a site first, which everyone can access on mobile devices.

 

Is there a business process—like registering a solar panel—that requires your customers to call an agent? Is there data that can only be accessed over the phone? How can you make this easier to access?

       

 

Unfortunately, to register solar panels, customers have to call an agent. Clearly, we need a web presence like an Experience Cloud site where customers can register any of our products online and do so at their own convenience.

 

Also, since we implemented Salesforce Knowledge, we need to share some of our articles online so that customers can troubleshoot routine issues themselves, 24/7, without having to phone an agent during business hours.

 

If you already have a knowledge base for your customers, are you using marketing automation to increase engagement and adoption of the portal?

       

 

Once we have a self-service site, and set up some social media channels, we will definitely look into message automation to drive traffic and awareness to it. Thank goodness we already have Salesforce Knowledge with some incredibly helpful articles that are ready to share online!

 

       

       

 

Social Presence

 

Question

       

 

Answer

 

Do you receive service-related questions on social media? Are the right people responding?

       

 

We don’t know. We have no social media presence right now, at least none we’re participating in or responding to. We have to add a variety of social media channels to our digital engagement plans—we have to reach customers where they are at.

 

Are customers chatting online about themes related to your product or industry?

       

 

Ryan De Lyon, our customer service manager, has heard some customers are posting questions about our solar panels on Twitter and Facebook. Since we are not monitoring those channels, we don’t really know what is going on there or how our brand is affected.

 

Ideally, once we set up social channels, we’d like to contribute to conversations about the solar panel industry and lead a few talking points to build new relationships and drive more business.

 

Are your customers already building online forums of their own to discuss your products or services?

       

 

We don’t know—we need to research this topic. A few months ago, one of our agents mentioned that there was a website displaying some of our solar panel manuals with a few comments posted on the site, but we’re not sure what that is about. Sounds like we need to look into it immediately.

 

Messaging

 

Question

       

 

Answer

 

Where does most of your customer traffic come from? Is it from mobile or desktop?

       

 

We don’t know. We think that most of the people we interact with have mobile phones and use text messaging. Once we have some of our digital channels up and running, like self-service sites or social media, we should post a survey to our customers and try to determine how many of them prefer communicating with us from mobile devices or desktops.

 

Do you know your percentage of customers using iPhones versus Android?

       

 

No, this is another area for a customer survey once we have digital channels set up. The answer will help us learn on which devices to build mobile service apps in the future.

 

Are your customers using international messaging apps like WeChat or WhatsApp?

       

 

Currently, we don’t have any international customers. In the future, however, we hope to expand globally, so this question is important for us as we plan for growth.

 

       

       

 

Automation & AI

 

Question

       

 

Answer

 

Do your agents spend time on data entry or repeating steps on every case that they work?

       

 

Our agents do type a lot of the same things in the console, but we’re already looking into the console’s Macros and Quick Text features to reduce repetitive tasks.

 

Macros will help agents select email templates, send emails, and change case statuses all with one click, whereas Quick Text will help agents send a variety of predefined messages to customers so they save time typing the same responses, no matter which channel.

 

Do you have a list of the top common questions, such as order status or password reset that you get from customers on a regular basis?

       

 

Yes, our agents spend a lot of time answering similar questions, especially on order statuses. If we had a self-service site or a text messaging channel where Einstein Bots could answer those questions, our agents could focus on solving more complex issues that require creativity and teamwork.

 

Do you have any picklist or checkbox fields on cases that machine learning could prefill for agents; any recommendations for knowledge articles or next actions for agents?

       

 

Yes, some useful fields to predict are Case Reason, Escalated, and Priority—having those automatically predicted would save agents time and clicks. And, anytime a useful article from our knowledge base could surface to an agent without searching for it is a productivity boost. Also, any kind of AI that suggests next-best actions for agents while they work would be a dream come true. Offloading some decisions during customer interactions could only help agents focus on building better relationships.

Digital Content Considerations

 

As Maria plans for digital engagement, she sees a unique thread that ties a number of features together—content. She wonders, “Do we have the right content ready to help agents and customers across multiple channels?” Based on the answers to the planning questions above, she knows the answer is no.

 

Traditionally, content is something only marketers, advertisers, or media agencies created. Support agents worked with a limited content choice of case open or case closed. If service teams created content, it was usually a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page on a website. With chatbots, SMS messaging, social media posts, or conversational interfaces from buttons all the way to online payments, content is a big piece of how to deliver service. Content is also a critical component for closing the loop on marketing, selling, and servicing. Content creation and curation requires a new set of skills for service. The teams at Ursa Major Solar will have to give considerable thought to the content that appears in each stage of a basic digital customer journey.

Next Steps for Digital Engagement

 

Now that Sita and Maria have answers to their questions, they take a step back to prioritize Service Cloud feature implementations. There are a lot of features they can set up, so they ask themselves a few more high-level questions.

 

    Which channel should we set up first, second, and so on?

    Are our agents trained to communicate on those channels?

    Will agents cover all channels or will some agents cover specific channels?

    Will the channel take into account international customers and multiple languages?

    Are our console and case management processes ready to support each new channel and automation or AI?

 

All of these questions should be asked before adding a new digital channel to a multichannel support model. Once Maria gets the answers she’s looking for, she can begin setting up specific service features for Ursa Major Solar. It looks like there’s a lot more Trailhead in Maria’s future.

Get Started with Web3

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Define Web3.

    Describe each evolution of the internet.

    Describe why Web3 is important for the future.

 

Welcome to the World Wide Web

 

A lot has changed since the advent of the internet in the early 1990s... The internet is alive. It’s an ever-changing technology that has become our default context. And as the internet has evolved—from a way to link documents to an accessible information system to an interconnected social network with millions of active users daily—the way we relate to each other and the world around us has changed.

 

Since its advent, the internet has enabled billions of users worldwide to learn, share, and connect globally for free. But millions of people can share and manipulate all of the information out there. This creates the enormous gaps in transparency, privacy, and security we experience with today’s internet ecosystem. This problem can theoretically be solved with the next generation of the internet, Web 3.0, often referred to as Web3.

 

How we connect with our friends, family, and coworkers has drastically shifted since the early ’90s, taking us from in-person to virtual, making the digital world more central to our everyday lives. We’re now seeing a new digital economy emerging with users at the center. Many believe we’re entering the next era, where the emerging technology and use cases we see today will continue to evolve and be played out over years and decades.

 

There’s a lot to unpack here. That’s why we created this module: to help make sense of where we’ve been, where we’re headed next, and what it all means.

 

Before we get to the details about Web3, let’s review some basics. Let’s start from the beginning.

The Evolution of the Internet

 

The evolution of the web is often divided into three stages: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0.

 

In the beginning, Web1 (1990 to 2000) democratized access to information. It was the first iteration of the world wide web. Most of us were consumers of content. And the creators were typically developers who built websites that contained information mainly in text or image format. Data and content were served from a static file system rather than a database, and sites didn’t have much interactivity at all. It was the Web of Read.

 

Most of us have experienced the wonders of the web in its current form, which is referred to as Web2 (2000 to 2021). This stage of the internet took Web1 further by democratizing connections and transactions. In this era, the simplicity built into the interfaces and applications enabled anyone to become a creator. It’s the Web of Read and Write.

 

As we experience the beginning of the Web3 era (2021 and beyond), applications will not run on a single server or store data in a single database owned by central authorities. Instead, Web3 applications will either run on blockchains, decentralized networks of many peer-to-peer servers (nodes), or a combination of the two. Web3 has the potential to democratize participation on the internet, enabling people to Read, Write, and Own both their data and digital identity.

Why Web3 Matters

 

Web3 is a point of evolution beyond where we have been operating. It’s an extension of Web2, which incorporates the advanced technologies we see coming to fruition today. The idea of Web3 is not only to fuel the formation of the metaverse and expansion of cryptocurrency, but to touch on other major industries in our globally interconnected world. The ultimate goal of Web3 is to create a more connected and open digital world.

 

Web3 does not require “permission,” meaning that central authorities will not decide who uses what services. Nor is there a need for an intermediary to facilitate virtual transactions between parties. Web3 theoretically better protects user privacy in certain ways because it’s these authorities and go-betweens in Web2 doing most of the data collection.

 

There are a number of advantages that Web3 has the potential to offer.

 

    Decentralization: Intermediaries would be removed from the equation, and blockchains would provide a transparent platform where the rules are unbreakable and data is publicly recorded.

    Ownership of data: End users will regain control of data by creating a public record of all their activity on the blockchain. Information could then be shared on a case-by-case and permissioned basis.

    Potential for reduction in hacks and data breaches: As more businesses and enterprises enter the space, there will be a large need for added security. This new technology can provide enhanced security because data will be decentralized and distributed. With further development of the rules and regulations, there is potential for reduction in large-scale hacks and data breaches where hackers would need to turn off the entire network of servers and record every transaction on the blockchain to access information.

    Permissionless blockchains: Anyone could create an address and interact with the network. Users will not be barred on account of geography, income, gender, orientation, or a host of other sociological and demographic factors.

 

While still in its early years, the mission behind Web3 is to create a decentralized web that creates new types of ownership, new ways of building trust and collaboration, and opens the doors to new possibilities. It has the potential to change how we interact with the web in the upcoming decades. Web3 is built on blockchain technology that validates user data, creates transaction transparency, and provides more secure payment options.

Where Do We Go Next?

 

The future is a decentralized, global marketplace. In the next unit, discover how Web3 is transforming industries and impacting businesses, society, and individuals alike.

Understand the Technologies Behind Web3

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Describe main components of Web3.

    Define NFT, blockchain, and cryptocurrency.

 

The Building Blocks of Web3: Blockchain

 

In today’s digital-first world, someone can buy a tweet, develop digital land, pay without a traditional currency, and track down data to the 1s and 0s, all from the comfort of their personal device. The innovative technology that enables this transparency is the blockchain.

 

A blockchain is a system of recording information on a tamper-resistant digital ledger distributed across its entire network of computer systems. Each block on the chain contains transaction data that records each transaction on participants’ ledgers. The transactions are public and cannot be changed, tampered with, or erased once published.

 

The idea of a blockchain came to life as a solution for accurate and fixed time stamps, similar to that of a notary. This fundamental aspect is still present in technology today.

 

Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT), where these transactions are programmable, immutable, and anonymous.

 

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that is programmable, anonymous, unanimous, distributed, immutable, and traceable.

 

Blockchains are constantly growing as blocks (transactions recording verified information) are added to the chain through every transaction. This increases the security of the entire ledger. The more blocks on the chain, the more secure the entire system becomes. This also allows regulators to easily identify if one of the blocks was tampered with, making hacking nearly impossible.

 

This is a young sector, and norms and standards are still emerging, including key issues such as sustainability. Companies, including Salesforce, have an opportunity to lead with values, and shape positive norms and benchmarks for using NFT and blockchain technology sustainably.

 

One key challenge in this space is related to sustainability. Many of the first generation cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin) rely on proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains, which require the use of energy (that is, work) to perform transactions. This has resulted in significant energy consumption and carbon emissions, with Bitcoin consuming as much power per year as the country of Thailand (as of February 2022), according to the Digiconomist.

 

The industry is continuing to address sustainability issues as their technology evolves, as we’re seeing with new and upcoming proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. Based on current models, it’s believed that PoS blockchains drastically reduce the energy consumption seen by current-state PoW blockchains (by as much as 99.95% according to Olga Kharif’s Bye-Bye, Miners! How Ethereum’s Big Change Will Work, which appeared on Bloomberg.com in 2021). Additionally, e-waste from PoW blockchain use may be eliminated by switching to PoS, which does not rely on physical hardware for securing the network.

 

Companies and organizations exploring blockchain applications should put in place clear sustainability strategies to quantify, minimize, neutralize, and disclose environmental impacts resulting in net zero emissions while driving increased sustainability in the sector more broadly.

 

Now that we’ve discussed the power, purpose, and impact of Web3, let’s look at how this technology is utilized in cryptocurrencies.

What Makes a Currency a Cryptocurrency?

 

The simple answer is that a cryptocurrency is a nontraditional digital currency built on the blockchain. To expand on this, let’s look at how cryptocurrencies came to be.

 

On October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto sent a paper to a group of cryptographers familiar with blockchain technology outlining a new form of “electronic cash” called Bitcoin. In this paper he outlined how the distributed ledger technology (DLT) was combined with several other technologies and concepts to create the cryptocurrencies of today. These digital currencies are essentially electronic cash protected through cryptographic mechanisms instead of a central authority like a bank, company, or government.

 

Blockchain technology is the foundation of modern cryptocurrencies, most commonly referred to as crypto. They got their name because of the heavy usage of cryptographic functions paired with the decentralized ledgers.

 

This system allows someone to purchase, trade, and own a variety of things, including NFTs and real estate. And with more integration into our financial system, many more applications can be expected.

 

Next, let’s explore the role of NFTs in the Web3 ecosystem.

What Is an NFT?

 

An NFT (nonfungible token) is a digital asset that represents either digital or physical objects like art, music, event tickets, videos, and more. They’re backed by smart contracts, which allows them to have distinctive properties such as secondary sales and transferable value.

 

Here’s how NFTs work.

 

    NFTs exist on a blockchain, which is a distributed public ledger that records transactions.

    NFTs are blockchain agnostic, meaning they can be built on a variety of blockchains.

    An NFT is created, or “minted” from digital objects that can represent both tangible and intangible items.

    An NFT can have only one owner at a time, and an NFT’s unique data makes it easy to verify the creator and owner, and enables token transfer between owners.

    The creator writes a smart contract that defines the use and royalties of the NFT.

 

The Value of NFTs

 

So why buy an NFT, since anyone can copy an image or a video with an internet search and a few clicks? Well, buying an NFT gives proof of ownership of a unique digital asset, which can include virtual goods, in-game items, digital art, and more. Because they are built on the blockchain, the transaction and ownership history is public. This information is validated and records authenticity of the seller and the sole ownership. Just like with a physical asset, this can be collected, traded, or sold. In the case of digital art or when purchasing NFTs in secondary marketplaces, buyers should follow best practices to avoid potential scams and other risks. (More on this in a later unit.)

 

This technology enables trust and transparency between the buyer and seller by having full access to the historical transactions. The transparency provided by the public records can give the buyer insight into the seller's transaction history. As this technology develops, we’ll see companies creating products that will verify a seller or provide a risk rating based on past digital interactions.

 

Anyone can search online and find an image, video, or NFT for that matter, and download it to a device. But that’s just saving a copy of the file, not obtaining rights to the digital ownership of the file. For example, there are a lot of copies of Van Gogh’s Starry Night painting, but there’s only one original Starry Night. In theory, NFTs offer collectors the ability to own the digital rights to a piece of art, similar to owning the original Starry Night. (Note: This does not account for creators who copy and repost the original artist’s work as their own. These artists are infringing on copyright and can face serious penalties.)

 

Brand-new experiences are being built around rare digital and physical goods through the use of NFTs. Given that any digital thing can be an NFT, there are several possible use cases. Some companies have already capitalized on this idea, doing things such as launching an NFT system to verify the authenticity of sneakers, or creating NFTs from video clips of landmark sports moments so fans can own the best plays.

 

To demonstrate NFTs’ utility, here are a few more use cases. We may continue to see more as time and technology progress.

 

    Gaming asset: NFTs can be used as characters in video games and possess gamification capabilities. For example, games have allowed players to purchase NFTs that serve as their game avatars. And as players play, they can earn more NFTs, such as an ultra-rare shield to help them in battle or a new accessory to deck out their avatar.

    Key: NFTs can act as key to unlocking content, like a subscription to a sports or news magazine. Only the holders of the NFT are able to access the articles, updates, and statistics in the publication.

    Digital twin: NFTs can be purely digital; however, some projects have allowed the creation of digital twins. This can be something like offering virtual clothes that can be worn in the metaverse or sending an identical physical object to NFT owners.

    IP ownership: Projects can allow members to own the intellectual property of their NFT. The owner doesn't have to ask the NFT creator to use their avatar—they have the ability to create an entire business around the NFT.

    Governance/voting: NFTs can give owners voting rights on upcoming promotional merchandise and new platform/product releases, among other things.

 

NFTs can create authenticity, establish value, democratize access to global markets, and build community. Let’s take a deeper look at how NFTs use smart contracts and wallets.

Smart Contracts and Wallets

 

How does someone actually use cryptocurrency to buy an NFT? Let’s start by understanding how these transactions are tracked with smart contracts and how users employ wallets to buy and hold onto their NFTs.

 

First let’s go over a few NFT-related terms.

 

Smart contracts: These are simply computer programs (a few lines of code), stored on a blockchain, that run when predetermined conditions are met. They can be viewed as an application of Web3. They’re typically used to automate the execution of an agreement (or contract), so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action, when certain conditions are met.

 

Wallets: A wallet is an app (or plugin), which enables users to access/retrieve, send, and receive digital assets. When a user acquires cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, they can store it in a wallet and from there use it to make transactions. There are two types of wallets.

 

    A custodial wallet is one created and secured by someone other than the true owner—for example, an account set up on Coinbase.

    A noncustodial wallet is one consumers create, own, and manage themselves. They often live directly within browsers (hot) or on offline devices (cold storage). Users self-manage security.

 

Smart contracts are used to protect buyers and sellers with automated contracts that are programmed to execute when certain conditions are met. These agreements can’t be changed or disputed once executed because smart contracts are immutable, distributed, and public.

 

With the ability to track when and to whom all NFTs are sold, smart contracts make purchasing NFTs at scale possible. This creates many possibilities, like enabling royalties for the original creator of an NFT, and offering protection for buyers.

 

To actually purchase an NFT, a buyer needs a wallet. There are many kinds of wallets, both custodial and noncustodial, each with pros and cons. Metamask, for example, is a noncustodial, browser-based wallet that’s currently the most popular to use with OpenSea, a popular NFT marketplace. With the rising popularity of NFTs and marketplaces, buyers should look into which wallet fits their needs best for security, ease of use, and compatibility with their marketplace of choice.

 

Wallets enable new capabilities for brands and users to interact. A few new possibilities include:

 

    New identity: Users may connect to a site and then provide access to any relevant information they want to share with the company for personalization. This provides a key to access the data, rather than sharing it.

    New experiences: In the near future, users may be able to have a wide range of assets in their wallets, essentially creating virtual versions of themselves. These 3D representations will allow them to try clothes on in real time and see the fit on their virtual selves.

    New ways to sign in: In the future, users may use NFTs on sites rather than passwords. Held in wallets, the NFTs will grant access without the need to remember passwords or have personal information stored in a brand’s network.

 

Now that you’ve learned about blockchain, crypto, and NFTs, let’s explore how all of these technologies can come together in the metaverse to create distinct digital experiences made possible through the engagement and participation of the evolving Web3 community.

Build Community in Web3

Learning Objectives

 

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

 

    Describe and define the metaverse.

    Describe main components of the Web3 community.

    Explain the utility of DAOs and dApps in building community

 

Where Worlds Collide: The Metaverse

 

As we’ve discussed, we’re in the early days of a new version of the internet called Web3. It’s being built on trusted, decentralized technology accessible to all. Platforms, apps, and data won't belong to large platforms—they’ll belong to users.

 

Some people are calling this new internet the metaverse. The metaverse is a new reality that reimagines how we interact with the world around us. Playing Fortnite or roaming around Roblox are great examples of Web2 metaverses, the difference is that the Web3 metaverse is backed by the chain.

 

The terms metaverse and Web3 have been used interchangeably, but they have inherent differences. According to Oxford Languages, the metaverse is “a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.” Users will only be able to jump between digital worlds with ownership of their assets intact if the metaverse is operating on a decentralized platform.

 

Web3 enables a more equitable metaverse, allowing for true ownership (and interoperability) across many metaverses/gamescapes and virtual realities. For example, a sword bought for one game could now be used in another.

 

The metaverse is where the Web3 community comes together to connect, learn, game, and engage with people around the world.

Community Comes First

 

Community and collaboration is central to Web3, providing a foundation that improves the likelihood of success and maintains relevance of a project, idea, event, and so forth.

 

The strength of an online community’s network is not only determined by how many people make up the community, but also the participants’ engagement on social media and community discussion forums. The decentralized nature of blockchain emphasizes the importance of community as a pillar of the next generation of internet.

 

So where are these communities if everything is decentralized? The short answer is, they’re everywhere around the world. They’re communicating via messaging platforms and social media, and organizing live events to attend together. Having tremendous reach and engagement across Discord, Twitter, and Telegram, these communities of diverse individuals are able to have a real impact. Since the foundation of these communities are messaging based, users are more engaged with content on the platform and have deeper connection to the people and content. They’re participants rather than simply users.

 

One way communities come together in Web3 is through DAOs and dApps. Keep reading to learn about these two functions of Web3.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

 

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a group or collective made up of individuals who organize around a common purpose. They’re managed by smart contracts, powered by tokens, have a shared treasury, and are governed by community voting. Examples range from the development of open-source software to a crowd-sourced attempt at purchasing the US Constitution.

 

DAOs are to Web3 what open-source projects are to Web1. DAOs are made up of people who share common goals and objectives, visions, and values. These groups unite to produce products or deliver services, and members/contributors are rewarded for their contributions to the collective.

 

DAOs represent a framework for community and shared responsibility—what companies represent in the context of Web2. This framework might very well function as the underpinning for the future of work (the next era of the gig economy).

Decentralized Apps (dApps)

 

Next, we have decentralized apps (dApps), which are applications (software), built on a decentralized network (blockchain), which combine a smart contract and a front-end (UI). dApps use the same front end as Web2 apps, but rely on blockchain technology rather than centralized servers or other centralized databases.

 

Web2 applications like Instagram or Twitter differ from Web3 applications in that they’re owned/operated by centralized authorities (for example, companies like Meta).

 

In the case of Web3 applications, no central authority or governing body has absolute control or governance rights when it comes to data recorded on/by the network. Instead, the data is verified by a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers.

 

In the future, we can expect that media, gaming, and finance industries will see a significant shift toward dApps, as they provide greater ownership for creators, enable play-to-earn, and create faster and more secure transactions.

Bringing It All Together

 

Each of these technologies—blockchain, cryptocurrencies, metaverses, DAOs, dApps—are paving the way for significant changes in our personal and work lives. But it’s the combination of these technologies that provides the foundation for Web3.

 

We can easily imagine a bright and shiny future powered by the increasing use cases and applications of blockchain technologies, but if we’re not careful, these can be a destabilizing force for society.

 

The same way that the two previous internet revolutions had positive and negative impacts, new technologies in Web3 carry potentially negative repercussions. Putting the control in the wrong hands can alter our future in undesirable ways if the goals are not aligned with the common good.

 

It’s a new era. Governments, business leaders, the scientific community, and citizens need to work together to define the paths, lead with values, and direct the technologies of Web3 to create sustainable applications and a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive society. Read on to learn more about approaching Web3 with ethics, trust, and safety at the forefront.

    Identify strategies and best practices for keeping safe and secure in the Web3 space.

 

Background

 

Blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFTs are driving innovation and commerce at scale. As with any early stage technology, potential outcomes can be unknown. Which is why it’s critical for those innovating in this space to do so in a responsible, ethical way. If we want Web3 to improve the lives of everyone within the ecosystem, not just a handful of people at the top, we need to design it in a values-led way.

 

Principles-Led Product Innovation

 

At Salesforce, we believe that products in the Web3 space should be created with these principles in mind.

 

    Trust and Security. We will embed best-in-class brand and consumer protections, identifying—and preventing the use of the product for—fraud, force, or fear.

    Sustainability. We commit to quantify, disclose, minimize, and neutralize environmental impacts resulting in net zero emissions while driving increased sustainability in the sector more broadly.

    Equality. We will provide guidance and guardrails to ensure fairness, diversity, and empowerment of customers and consumers.

    Accountability. We will empower the end-user with explainable governance and engage stakeholders in ongoing evaluation.

    Integrity and Transparency. We commit to share clear, precise communication about the product and create trusted experiences and marketplaces where safety is top of mind.

 

We believe that by leading with our values, we can help guide this new space in a positive direction.

The Challenges of an Emerging Web3 Landscape

 

While there is much to be excited about when it comes to Web3, there’s also reason to proceed with a degree of caution as the space grows and matures. Here are some of the known and potential risks within the ecosystem.

 

Speculative Bubbles

 

The Dutch tulip mania from 1634 to 1637 is the classic example of a significant difference between the financial value of an asset and its intrinsic value. It created a speculative bubble, which saw the price of tulips reach incredibly high levels. There have been many such bubbles since, and some claim that Web3 is in such a moment.

 

Price Volatility

 

Assets in Web3 are susceptible to price volatility, since Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be argued to have no intrinsic value. And unlike other traditional currencies, they aren’t backed by a government or central bank. As a result, their price is driven only by supply and demand. As their value increases, this success may attract new investors, sending prices upward. On the flip side, a negative event or even a tweet can drive prices downward.

 

Lack of Diversity

 

NFTs sit at the intersection of two historically white and male dominated industries: visual art and crypto. The bulk of NFT sales—roughly 77%—are flowing to male creators while only 5% of sales go to female artists. Similarly, it’s posited that the average NFT purchaser is a 38-year-old male who makes over $100,000/year. This poses an issue for promoting equality and inclusion. If most of the NFT community is male and white, there is market pressure to create NFTs that mirror this population and create barriers to entry for nonwhite, nonmale folks to get involved in the space.

 

Lack of Privacy

 

One of the benefits of cryptocurrency is it allows for anonymity. Connecting one’s identity to a wallet is optional, and many people prefer to keep their cryptocurrency wallet address private for good reason. Imagine if, when you sent digital payment to a lunch partner for your half of the meal, they could now see every other transaction you’d ever made—and not just on that platform, but the ones you made with your credit card, bank transfer, or other apps, and with no option to set the visibility of the transfers to “private.”

 

Immutability

 

Another feature of blockchains is their immutability: Once data is written to the blockchain, it’s there forever. While this has many useful applications, such as for storing transaction records, it can be a challenge for user-created data, particularly when considering online abuse and harassment. If someone stores harmful, inflammatory or hateful material on a blockchain, it cannot be removed. The platforms might be petitioned to hide the content, but the offensive content would still remain on the chain.

 

Lack of Third-Party Protection

 

Third-party intermediaries, like banks or credit unions, play a critical role in safeguarding customers’ interests. Banks, for example, have ways of detecting activity by malicious actors, and consumers can challenge fraudulent transactions on their credit cards. When transactions take place without a third party, customers have no one to whom they can appeal for help. For example, if someone loses their private key—which functions like a password—then owners can no longer access their wallets, with no recourse. In January 2021, The New York Times reported that $140 billion worth of bitcoin is locked in wallets whose private keys have been lost or forgotten.

The Early Days of Regulation

 

Today, cryptocurrencies and NFTs are largely exempt from legal and financial regulation, which means there is little or no protection for those who create, invest, or trade in them.

 

For example:

 

Data Hosting and Storage: An NFT and the digital asset it represents are usually stored separately. The NFT is stored on the blockchain and contains information about where the digital asset is located, but the NFT could be deleted or the server hosting it could fail or be hacked. This would make the NFT worth little or nothing—and the law has not yet addressed what rights the NFT owner would have in such a situation.

 

Data Protection: NFTs may contain personal information that is subject to data protection laws. Some of these laws—like GDPR (the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation)—allow individuals to erase or amend their personal data. However, NFTs are linked to the blockchain, where that is impossible (immutability!). These issues of security and data sharing for NFTs have so far received little consideration.

 

Intellectual Property Rights: The buyer of an NFT may erroneously think they own the actual art associated with the NFT. In reality, the only person with the right to copy, distribute, alter, or publicly display the art is its original creator. There is the possibility that a disgruntled NFT buyer may bring legal action if they feel that there was misrepresentation when they were sold the NFT, as they believed they were buying the copyright.

 

Taxation: The US and other nations have little or no legislation in this regard, nor any official advice relating to NFTs and tax. While it can be expected that profits and losses relating to NFTs would be liable for capital gains tax, and that the NFTs themselves would be considered assets for the purposes of other taxes—including inheritance tax—the official position has yet to be confirmed.

Safety and Security in Web3

 

Beyond the dynamics noted, there are a number of scams and frauds that are perpetrated in the NFT space, and it’s useful to be able to recognize and avoid them. Here are the six most common.

 

Type

       

 

Description

 

Rug pull

       

 

The originators of a crypto project take the capital raised from a token sale and disappear.

 

Pump and dump

       

 

A particular crypto asset is hyped, leading to a short-term spike in the asset’s price as buy orders flood in. The instigators then sell off their holdings, triggering a crash, with other investors left “holding the bag.”

 

Wash trading

       

 

The price of a crypto asset is artificially inflated by repeatedly trading it between wallets controlled by the same individual or group.

 

Ponzi scheme

       

 

Capital from later investors in a crypto asset is used to pay returns to earlier investors.

 

Hacking

       

 

Protocols or wallets are hacked and owners’ crypto assets stolen.

 

Phishing

       

 

Attackers use social engineering techniques to trick a target into revealing information that can be used to gain access to their crypto assets.

Ways to Protect Yourself

 

How to Spot a Scam

 

As a user, the first step of prevention is to keep your eyes peeled for potential signs of scams. Here’s how to recognize some common, dubious tactics.

 

    Phishing: Users get a seemingly legitimate email from a platform or exchange they frequently use, with a malicious link embedded that lures them to make a transaction. Or it may even inject malware that scans for seed phrases stored in laptops.

    Hacking: Hackers sometimes airdrop malicious NFTs to user accounts as a Trojan Horse. Interacting with these malicious NFT airdrops prompt the user to sign a message that allows hackers to gain access and drain the account.

    FOMO: A cool new project comes up with a timer counting down on the purchase page, inducing serious FOMO (fear of missing out). When the user signs the transaction and makes that purchase, hackers obtain access to their wallets. Unknown to the user, the purchase page was linked to a scam URL.

 

Protect Your Seed Phrase and Secure Your Device

 

A seed phrase is a group of words that are used to restore a crypto wallet. A seed phrase looks like this:

 

rebuild-glow-language-lady-mushroom-poverty-episode-slow-meat-analyst-knee-output-oblige-couch-tilt

 

It’s very important to keep this phrase private and secure, since anyone with your seed phrase can use it to take over your wallet.

 

This is where hackers come in and use various methods, including social engineering, to try and steal your seed phrase. One form of this is a scam where they pretend to be support staff from a marketplace or crypto business and ask for your details like your seed phrase or Metamask recovery QR code. Even experienced crypto-natives have fallen for these types of scams. Whenever someone asks you for this information, it should immediately set off alarm bells in your head.

 

Whatever type of wallet you use, take caution and practice a security-conscious approach to keeping your device and browser clear of any potential malware. This includes doing due diligence on websites you interact with, keeping your software up-to-date with security patches, and ignoring emails, links, or DMs from strangers.

Best Practices

 

Now that you’re aware of potential risks, let’s discuss how to mitigate them! Here are our overall best practices for staying safe in the new Web3 reality.

 

    Always visit the original website—a trusted, first-party marketplace—for any sale or offer.

    Only download applications and software from the originating source.

    If you’re using them, disable direct messages on Telegram and Discord from people who are not on your friends list.

    Never click any link sent to you from an unverified source without properly checking it.

    Never send your seed phrase to anyone.

    Never open an email link that looks suspicious.

    Never install any file with a “.exe” or “.scr” extension sent to you by an unknown sender.

    Never fill your wallet password and seed phrase into any form that you are not sure of.

    Store your cryptocurrency in a cold wallet or have multiple wallets (separating your daily use wallet from the wallet where you keep the bulk of your funds).

    Generate your keys securely—on a newly reset, offline device if possible.

    Keep your device, such as mobile phone or desktop, clear of malware and update frequently to the latest security patch.

    Make sure you interact only with audited smart contracts.

    Disconnect your wallet after every transaction.

    Be vigilant—always double-check your transactions, recipient addresses, and browser URL.

    Use common sense and trust your intuition—if something seems too good to be true, well, it just might be.

 

Conclusion

 

As a company, Salesforce is deeply committed to creating technology with ethics and inclusion built-in—not bolted on. Our Office of Ethical and Humane Use actively partners with our product and engineering teams to approach product development with intention, identifying risks and innovating new solutions with our values at the core. The potential risks should not stop you from exploring and interacting with crypto and NFTs. There’s a world of opportunity out there, but just remember to take the necessary steps to protect yourself and proceed with caution.

    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 1
    1 Introduction
    This document was previously known as the Arrangements Document. The purpose of this
    document is to:
    ¨ assist centres to implement, deliver, and manage the qualification
    ¨ provide a guide for new staff involved in offering the qualification
    ¨ inform course managers, teaching staff, assessors, learners, employers, and Higher
    Education institutions of the aims and purpose of the qualification
    ¨ provide details of the range of learners that the qualification is suitable for and the
    progression opportunities
    This document has been written in order to assist centres in preparing for approval of the new
    SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards and
    maintaining the awards thereafter. These two awards were developed under the new SQA
    Design Principles, were validated in March 2005, and replace the existing SQA Advanced
    Certificate in Engineering: Electrical and the SQA Advanced Diploma in Engineering: Electrical.
    This document includes details on the background to the development of the new awards, their
    aims (both general and specific), recommended access requirements, information about the
    structure of the awards, recommendations on delivery and assessment and other guidance for
    centres.
    2 Rationale for the revisions of the awards
    2.1 Electrical Engineering
    The term Electrical Engineering in the context of this document covers the range of subjects
    traditionally included in SQA Advanced Qualifications in Electrical Engineering, namely power,
    plant and electrical installation. The title Electrical Engineering is intended to provide
    candidates, lecturers, Higher Education, employers and professional bodies with a clear,
    unambiguous title.
    Electronics has not been included in the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced
    Diploma in Electrical Engineering titles as only sufficient electronics has been included in both
    awards to underpin studies in the various branches of electrical engineering.
    2.2 SQA Advanced Engineering Frameworks
    In 1996 the SQA validated nationally a large number of new SQA Advanced Engineering
    awards including two awards entitled SQA Advanced Certificate in Engineering: Electrical and
    SQA Advanced Diploma in Engineering: Electrical. A major difference between these and
    previous awards were that they all sat within an SQA Advanced Engineering Framework which
    in general terms consisted, for both SQA Advanced Certificates and SQA Advanced Diplomas,
    of a common core of units (units common to all SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced
    Diploma in Engineering awards), a principles/technology and optional sections. The benefits of
    this Framework structure were seen to include the following:
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 2
    ¨ provide a wide range of SQA Advanced Engineering qualifications to meet the needs of
    different engineering sectors
    ¨ improve the credibility and esteem of individual SQA Advanced Engineering awards
    ¨ clarify those competencies that were general to all incorporated engineers and those that
    were specific to particular engineering disciplines
    ¨ provide opportunities for the efficient delivery of SQA Advanced Engineering units by, for
    example, incorporating units that were common to a number of different SQA Advanced
    awards
    ¨ facilitate better progression between SQA Advanced Certificate, SQA Advanced Diploma
    and degree engineering awards
    Prior to the development of any SQA Advanced Engineering awards a major consultation
    exercise was undertaken on the overarching SQA Advanced Engineering Framework to test the
    validity of the Framework. This consultation comprised of the following five strands:
    ¨ a questionnaire survey with stakeholders of SQA Advanced Engineering awards
    ¨ a series of meetings with various interested stakeholders of SQA Advanced Engineering
    awards
    ¨ desk based research
    ¨ discussions (followed by endorsement) of a proposed SQA Advanced Engineering
    Framework at an SQA Advanced Engineering Steering Group meeting
    ¨ a major consultation event with FE colleges on 24 May 2002 which included a
    questionnaire survey
    The consultation revealed continuing strong support for an overarching SQA Advanced
    Engineering Framework but with the following modifications:
    ¨ a reduction in the number of common core units
    ¨ a strengthening of the Principles/Technology section with an even stronger emphasis on
    the teaching of core engineering principles and technologies
    Optional sections are retained in all SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
    Engineering awards.
    The revised SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Engineering
    Frameworks are shown in block diagram form in Figures 2.1 and 2.2. It should be noted that the
    PDAs shown in both diagrams may be developed as more SQA Advanced units come on
    stream; currently none of these PDAs exist.

    2.3 History and market research to support the SQA Advanced
    Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    2.3.1 History of the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in
    Electrical Engineering awards
    The introduction of the SCOTVEC Advanced Courses Development Programme lead
    to the replacement of the 132 SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical and Electronic
    Engineering award by a competence based SQA Advanced Diploma in Electronic and
    Electrical Engineering in 1989. Shortly after an SQA Advanced Certificate in Electronic
    and Electrical Engineering was introduced as part of a national development and
    replaced the 101 SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
    However, there continued to be little commonality between the new SQA Advanced
    Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma awards. The first attempt to harmonise the two
    awards took place as part of a consortium development in the early nineties. In 1995
    and 1996 the two awards were totally harmonised (eg the SQA Advanced Certificate in
    Electrical Engineering becoming effectively the first year of the SQA Advanced
    Diploma) as part of a major SCOTVEC national development which saw the
    introduction of an overarching SQA Advanced Engineering Framework. The two new
    awards represent a further development of SQA Advanced Engineering awards taking
    full account the new SQA Advanced Design Principles and providing an opportunity to
    update the awards in light of technological and educational developments.
    2.3.2 Market research
    The development of the new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
    in Electrical Engineering awards included extensive market research which is
    summarised below in Table 2.3.
    Table 2.3
    Stakeholder Method
    All Major desk based research gathering and analysing
    data from various sources (eg SEMTA, FutureSkills
    Scotland, etc).
    Delivery Centres Initial postal survey of all delivery centres followed by
    two National seminars.
    Draft units, assessment exemplars and outlines of
    graded units were made available to centres.
    Employers Surveys of employers were carried out at the
    commencement of the development of the two
    awards and when the two award structures and units
    were nearing finalisation. Information obtained from
    employers helped to inform both structure and unit
    development.
    Higher Education Letters of support for articulation between the new
    SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced
    Diploma in Electrical Engineering and degree awards
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 6
    were received from seven Higher Education
    institutions.
    Professional Bodies The Chair of the Institute of Incorporated Engineers
    was a member of the Validation Panel and provided a
    broad measure of support for the two new
    developments at the Validation Event which was later
    confirmed in writing.
    Health and Safety
    Executive
    A representative from the Health and Safety
    Executive provided some invaluable input into the
    development of the Electrical Safety Unit and other
    units with significant safety content.
    Students While not consulted directly the student experience of
    the current SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
    Advanced Diploma in Engineering: Electrical was
    taken fully into account in the new developments.
    2.4 Candidates
    2.4.1 SQA Advanced Certificate Candidates
    Candidates at SQA Advanced Certificate level may already be in employment and will
    attend centres on a day-release or other part-time basis. The SQA Advanced
    Certificate framework structure is flexible enough to allow centres to deliver the SQA
    Advanced Certificate award by various modes of delivery for example, two-year day-
    release, evening attendance etc.
    The options chosen by employed candidates may reflect the branch of industry in
    which they are employed or may be used to gain knowledge of other areas within
    electrical engineering in order to improve their career opportunities in the employment
    market. Part-time candidates may also use the SQA Advanced Certificate award to
    gain entry to degree level studies.
    Full-time SQA Advanced Certificate candidates may be school leavers intending to
    articulate to a university degree course, or candidates who wish to progress from an
    appropriate National Certificate qualification. Full-time candidates may also be more
    mature persons who are seeking a change of employment.
    Since the SQA Advanced Certificate award forms an integral part of the SQA
    Advanced Diploma award, full-time candidates will complete 15 unit credits in the first
    year of the course, 12 of these meeting the SQA Advanced Certificate requirements.
    In addition to university entrance, successful full-time SQA Advanced Certificate
    candidates have enhanced their prospects of gaining employment in the Electrical
    Engineering industry.
    2.4.2 SQA Advanced Diploma Candidates
    The SQA Advanced Diploma award programme will normally be delivered on a two-
    year full-time basis, although this does not preclude other delivery patterns. This being
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 7
    the case, SQA Advanced Diploma candidates may be school leavers who have an
    interest in some aspect of electrical engineering and wish to include this in their career
    path. This may be candidates who wish to progress from an appropriate National
    Certificate qualification or candidates who have previously completed the SQA
    Advanced Certificate award and wish to progress to the SQA Advanced Diploma. The
    typical SQA Advanced Diploma candidate will therefore be a young person intending to
    articulate to a university degree course. The units of the SQA Advanced
    Certificate/Diploma framework have been designed to introduce candidates to
    electrical engineering and to take topics to a more advanced level than is possible in
    the SQA Advanced Certificate.
    Mature candidates may also embark on the SQA Advanced Diploma programme. The
    SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team and unit writers were aware that such
    candidates may not have studied for some time and will require additional support in
    developing their learning skills. The SQA Advanced Electrical units have been
    designed as far as possible to provide candidates with opportunities to develop critical
    knowledge and understanding of theory and practical hands-on skills required by
    practising electrical incorporated engineers.

    3.5 How the General Aims are met in the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma Award
    Structures and Content
    Aim no. How it is met in SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
    3.1.1 For many years, SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering qualifications have equipped
    candidates to seek employment in a wide range of manufacturing, service and public sector organisations. Market research indicates
    that SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering Electrical Engineering awards are still regarded
    as the minimum qualifications required by many organisations to work at electrical technician or incorporated engineer level.
    3.1.2 There has been a long tradition of candidates in employment taking SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical and Electronic awards on
    a part-time basis to increase their knowledge of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and enhance their career development. In
    recent years, with increased commonality between SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    awards and greater flexibility in the way these awards are delivered, candidates in employment have increasingly taken SQA
    Advanced Diplomas on a part-time basis to expand their knowledge and skills in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and improve
    their career prospects. The two new awards contain a balance of core principles and up-to-date knowledge and skills in Electrical
    Engineering which lends themselves to the Continuous Professional Development and career development of candidates working at
    electrical technician and incorporated engineer levels. Furthermore, the award structures have been designed to allow for easy
    progression between SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma awards.
    3.1.3 All units within the new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards have been levelled
    at SCQF levels 6, 7 or 8. The two new awards also conform to the SQA levelling requirements for SQA Advanced Certificate and
    SQA Advanced Diploma awards. Thus, successful completion of one or both awards will allow progression within the SCQF.
    3.1.4 The nature of Electrical Engineering as a discipline lends itself to both the analysis and synthesis of problems. For example, when a
    complex electrical and electronic system is analysed (using, say, a block diagram approach) by breaking it down into separate
    functional parts or alternatively the synthesis of a complex system from simpler electrical and electronic systems. The two new
    awards allow these important skills to be developed further both in the technical subjects and in the core Communication, Information
    Technology and Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development units.

    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 11
    Aim no. How it is met in SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
    3.1.5 The new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards provide centres with an
    opportunity to enhance learning skills not least by creating opportunities for candidates to combine theory and practice to achieve
    a real understanding of a subject. For example, some units recommend significant use of practical work and/or computer
    simulation to reinforce learning. It is also anticipated that centres will use innovative delivery approaches that may make use of
    sophisticated electrical and electronic laboratory equipment and/or online delivery and/or Virtual Learning Environments to
    enhance candidate learning.
    By their very nature Engineering courses require the transfer of technical knowledge and skills form one area to another. For
    example, a significant level of Electrical Principles and Mathematics has been included in both SQA Advanced Certificate and
    SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards because these subjects provide underpinning knowledge,
    understanding and skills which are used elsewhere in both awards. Candidates will also have an opportunity to use the
    Communication and Information Technology knowledge and skills developed in the mandatory core units in other parts of the
    awards to support such activities as report writing, presentation and the application of specialist software packages. Core Skills in
    general, and problem solving in particular, have been regarded as very important by the SQA Advanced Electrical Development
    Team since it is recognised that a good level of competence in these is essential in the work of an incorporated electrical
    technician.
    3.3.1 The double credit (16 SCQF points) Engineering Project Graded Unit in the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    award provides opportunities for candidates to develop both their planning and project management knowledge and skills.
    3.3.2 The Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development Unit provides candidates with the opportunities to develop
    their investigative skills by exploring the external and internal factors that affect the performance of a modern company and the
    different ways that people learn. The Engineering Project also requires candidates to undertake some investigations into the
    background to and a range of solutions for their engineering project.

    3.6 How the Specific Aims are met in the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma Award
    Structures and Content
    Aim no. How it is met in SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
    3.2.1 An SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering award has been recognised for many years
    by employers and other stakeholders of these awards as appropriate qualifications for persons wishing to work at electrical
    technician or senior technician levels. Market research indicates that there is a growing demand for people with technician level
    skills in electrical and electronic engineering especially as companies automate a lot more of their processes. Thus, it is
    confidently anticipated that those achieving the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    awards will find employment as electrical technicians and incorporated electrical engineers in a wide range of small, medium and
    large companies.
    3.2.2
    &
    3.2.3
    An SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in no longer satisfies fully the academic requirements for Incorporated
    Engineer status although these qualifications continue to completely satisfy Engineering Technician requirements. The minimum
    qualification for Incorporated Engineer is an ordinary degree.
    Given the clear progression routes that have been established between existing SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced
    Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards and degree courses by many FE colleges and universities, it is strongly anticipated that
    similar progression routes will also be developed between the new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in
    Electrical Engineering awards and degree courses. Thus, SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
    Engineering awards will continue to form very important ‘stepping stones’ towards candidates achieving degrees (and, thus,
    satisfy fully the academic requirements for Incorporated Engineer status). Progression arrangements between SQA Advanced
    Certificates, SQA Advanced Diplomas and degrees can only be strengthened with the full implementation of the SCQF. Seven
    letters have been received from Scottish Universities confirming articulation arrangements between the new SQA Advanced
    Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards and degree programmes.

    5.3 Graded Units
    The purpose of the Graded Unit for both the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
    Advanced Diploma awards is to assess the candidate’s ability to apply and integrate
    knowledge and/or skills gained within individual units. By this means candidates will
    demonstrate that they have achieved the specific aims of the awards as detailed in
    Sections 3.2 and 3.4. The Graded Units also provide the means by which a candidate’s
    achievement can be graded.
    SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering candidates will undertake a one
    Credit Graded Unit at level 7. This will be in the form of a 3-hour written examination.
    SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering candidates will also do the SQA
    Advanced Certificate Graded Unit but, in addition, will undertake a two Credit Graded
    Unit at level 8. This will take the form of a practical assignment/project.
    5.3.1 Types of Graded Units
    SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 — Examination
    It will be noted that the Graded Unit draws on Outcomes in the mandatory section of the
    award which are studied by all SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering
    candidates.
    The assessment for the Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 consists of an examination
    paper which should last three hours.
    It is recommended that candidates do not sit the Graded Unit examination until the end
    of the SQA Advanced Certificate (1st Year of the SQA Advanced Diploma), given the
    range of units that it draws from.
    SQA Advanced Diploma Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 2 — Project
    The nature of the project activity is such that it is likely that centres will wish their
    candidates to embark on it from the start of the second year of the SQA Advanced
    Diploma in Electrical Engineering programme. As it is anticipated that centres will deliver
    the SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering as part of the first year of the
    SQA Advanced Diploma, it is recommended that candidates have completed all SQA
    Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering units, including the SQA Advanced
    Certificate Graded Unit, before commencing the project.
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 19
    In principle, the project can draw on any units in the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
    Engineering framework although the majority of units should be at SCQF level 8. The
    project can be taken from one Electrical Engineering area (eg Electrical Machines) or it
    can span more than one technical area. However, its principal purpose is not to integrate
    technical content (this is covered in Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1) but rather to
    combine such knowledge and skills as planning, construction, testing, evaluating and
    reporting.
    5.3.2 Rationale for the Graded Units Assessment
    The assessment methods ie an examination for Graded Unit 1 and a project for Graded
    Unit 2 were decided through consultation with industry and delivering centres during
    initial consultation on the overarching SQA Advanced Engineering Framework (see SQA
    Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electronics Validation Document
    for more details).
    The consultation indicated that an ‘examination’ provided a more accurate way of
    assessing candidates’ abilities to apply and integrate knowledge and understanding from
    various technical and related areas, such as Communication. Furthermore, it was
    considered that during their SQA Advanced Certificate studies candidates will not
    normally develop fully the necessary knowledge and skills to complete a project.
    A project was preferred at the SQA Advanced Diploma level because a project-based
    assignment provides candidates with opportunities to demonstrate not only their
    knowledge and skills in a technical area(s) but also in areas such as planning,
    construction, testing, evaluating and reporting which are important aims within the SQA
    Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering award.

    5.4 Core Skills
    The SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    awards have been designed using the new SQA Advanced Design Principles and
    therefore the importance of Core Skills has been recognised and been incorporated,
    where appropriate, throughout the awards.
    5.4.1 SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering
    Core Skills Exit Profile
    A candidate who successfully achieves an SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical
    Engineering will automatically obtain the following Core Skills exit profile:
    ¨ Communication Higher (fully embedded in the unit Communication: Practical
    Skills)
    ¨ Numeracy Using Number component of Numeracy Core Skill at Higher
    (embedded in the unit Mathematics for Engineering 1:
    Electronics and Electrical)
    Core Skills Entry Profile
    Given the information on Core Skills provided in the previous section the following
    candidate Core Skills entry profile is recommended:
    ¨ Communication Intermediate 2
    ¨ Information Technology Intermediate 2
    ¨ Numeracy Intermediate 2
    ¨ Problem Solving Intermediate 2

    5.5 Conditions of the Award
    The conditions of award for SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in
    Electrical Engineering qualifications are as follows:
    5.5.1 SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering
    A candidate will be awarded SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering on
    successful completion of 11 unit credits plus 1 Graded Unit based on the SQA Advanced
    Certificate in Electrical Engineering award structure shown in Section 5.1. More specifically
    this award structure requires that a candidate achieves the following:
    ¨ the 1 unit credit Communication: Practical Skills within the mandatory section
    ¨ the remaining eight unit credits from the mandatory section
    ¨ two unit credits from the optional section
    ¨ Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 Examination
    5.5.2 SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    A candidate will be awarded SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering on
    successful completion of 27 unit credits plus 3 Graded Unit Assessment credits based on
    the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering award structure shown in Section 5.2.
    More specifically this award structure requires that candidates achieve the following:
    ¨ the 3 unit credits Communication: Practical Skills, Information Technology:
    Applications Software 1 and Business Awareness and Continuing Professional
    Development within the mandatory section
    ¨ remaining 17 unit credits from the mandatory section
    ¨ seven unit credits from the optional section
    ¨ Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 and Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit
    5.6 SCQF levels
    Figures 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 show the distribution of SCQF levels in the SQA Advanced
    Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards respectively in
    the mandatory sections. It can be seen from Figure 5.6.1 that all units in the SQA
    Advanced Certificate Electrical Engineering mandatory section are at level 7 except for
    two, the Mathematics for Engineering 1: Electronic and Electrical Unit and the Application
    of Electrical and Electronic Instruments Unit, which are both at level 6. The Table shows
    that the number of SCQF level 7 units substantially exceeds the minimum of 48 SCQF
    credit points required to be in an SQA Advanced Certificate to satisfy the new SQA
    Advanced Design Principles.
    From the outset of developments, the SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team
    recognised that the level of Mathematics achieved by the average candidate entering the
    current SQA Advanced Certificate in Engineering: Electrical award was around
    Intermediate 2 (Standard Grade Credit level) and there was a need to include a SCQF
    level 6 Mathematics Unit in the SQA Advanced Certificate] (and the first year of the SQA
    Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering) which consolidated candidates’ existing
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 29
    knowledge and understanding of Mathematics particularly in the areas of transposing and
    solving equations and trigonometry, skills that are so important in the field of Electrical
    Engineering.
    The Application of Electrical and Electronic Instruments Unit was originally levelled at
    SCQF level 7, but was relevelled at SCQF level 6 as a result of the validation process.
    As noted above, the SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team has levelled the
    remaining units in the mandatory section of the SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical
    Engineering at SCQF level 7. The SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team used as
    their benchmarks for levelling, the Highers in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and
    various NQ Electronic and Electrical Engineering units and their knowledge of the content
    of existing degree courses in Electronic and Electrical Engineering.
    It can be seen from Figure 5.6.2 that the minimum number of SCQF level 8 units a
    candidate has to take in the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering is 64 SCQF
    credit points which meets the minimum requirement of 64 SCQF credit points as stated in
    the SQA Advanced Design Principles. However, it is anticipated that most candidates will
    undertake some optional units at level 8 which will mean that they will comfortably exceed
    this minimum requirement. The case for the two level 6 units in the SQA Advanced
    Diploma in Electrical Engineering has already been presented above. A number of the
    SCQF level 8 units in the SQA Advanced Diploma follow on from corresponding level 7
    units and are, therefore, appropriately levelled at SCQF level 8. The SQA Advanced
    Electrical Development Team also used their knowledge of existing second year degree
    courses to level units in the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering award.

    6 Approaches to delivery and assessment
    6.1 Content and context
    Throughout the design and development of the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
    Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards the SQA Advanced Electrical
    Development Team has placed a high priority on producing awards that allow candidates
    to develop appropriate technical and practical skills. As indicated earlier, it is not possible
    to quantify such technical and practice skills in exact detail. However, the Development
    Team has taken the view that the best way to prepare candidates to meet the changing
    technical and practical requirements of the modern Electrical industry is to ensure
    candidates have a solid foundation of theory and practice upon which they can build new
    knowledge, understanding and skills. Thus, the mandatory section of the SQA Advanced
    Certificate in Electrical Engineering contains fundamental studies in Electrical Principles,
    Electrical Machines, Power Systems, Electrical Safety and Application of Instruments.
    The SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical mandatory section builds on and extends these
    studies. The studies in Electrical Engineering are underpinned by the inclusion of a core
    Mathematics Unit in the SQA Advanced Certificate and two core Mathematics units in the
    SQA Advanced Diploma. The SQA Advanced in Electrical Development Team believes
    that a good grasp of mathematics is essential to the understanding of Electrical
    Engineering.
    The optional sections of both the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
    in Electrical Engineering provide candidates with the opportunity to specialise in technical
    and/or non-technical subjects. In line with normal good practice centres are encouraged
    to advise candidates to choose those options that best meet their future career and
    educational aspirations.
    The SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team has also ensured that the two new
    awards contain opportunities for candidates to develop a range of related skills which
    would make the holder of the awards better prepared for employment and/or degree
    studies. For example, the Communication: Practical Skills Unit has been included within
    the mandatory sections of both SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma
    awards to provide candidates with the opportunity to develop their written and group
    discussion skills about complex vocational issues.
    While a discrete Information Technology unit is no longer included within the SQA
    Advanced Certificate mandatory section centres will still have the opportunity to access
    such a unit via the optional section of the SQA Advanced Certificate (Information
    Technology: Applications Software 1). Even where centres choose not to select this unit
    from the optional section there are a number of opportunities to develop Information
    Technology knowledge and skills within individual units. The Information Technology:
    Applications Software 1 unit has been included within the core of the SQA Advanced
    Diploma to allow centres to concentrate on business applications, such as word
    processing, spreadsheets, databases, or engineering specific applications or a
    combination of the two.
    A new type of Business Studies unit, entitled Business Awareness and Continuing
    Professional Development, has been included within the mandatory section of the SQA
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 31
    Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering. This unit focuses on two areas which the
    SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team considered important to working in the
    modern electrical industry: namely the external and internal factors that affect business
    performance and the need for continuing learning and development if candidates are to
    have sustainable and rewarding employment in the future.
    6.2 Delivery
    The new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
    Engineering awards can be delivered on a full-time, block-release, part-time day or part-
    time evening basis.
    In timetabling the two new awards, centre staff should take account of information
    contained in the recommended prior knowledge and skills statement in unit specifications
    in sequencing the delivery of units. For example, the Single Phase AC Circuits unit would
    normally be delivered before the Electrical Networks and Resonance. Examples of a full-
    time SQA Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering and 2nd Year SQA Advanced
    Diploma in Electrical Engineering timetables are shown in Appendix 1.
    One of the key reasons the SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team has sought to
    reduce the time candidates have to spend on summative unit assessment is to provide
    lecturers with more time to deliver units. Lecturers are encouraged, in particular, to use
    this additional time to reinforce learning in core electrical principles and technologies and
    enhance the development of candidates’ practical electrical skills.
    Lecturers may use a variety of teaching and learning approaches in delivering the units in
    the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    awards. These may include lecturing, group work, laboratory and practical work,
    computer simulation (using appropriate software packages), project work and case
    studies. The use of open and distance learning and online materials may help to
    supplement and support the learning that takes place in the classroom, laboratory or
    workshop.
    Industrial visits are encouraged wherever possible to provide ‘real life’ industrial
    examples of the application of the theory and practice learned in the classroom,
    laboratory or workshop.
    The SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team recognises the very important role
    computer simulation, such as electrical installation software, plays in the modern
    electrical industry. The Team would actively encourage the use of computer simulation
    wherever appropriate but not at the expense of candidates doing practical work. The
    Team believe it is very important that candidates get as much exposure as possible to
    practical electrical hand skills, the use of electrical and electronic test equipment and
    other practical electrical activities if they are to be suitably prepared to work in industry.
    Lecturers should also seek opportunities to integrate Core Skills within their teaching and
    learning programmes. Such opportunities may include the following:
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 32
    Communication
    ¨ Providing candidates opportunities to develop their oral skills by allowing them to
    give full answers to questions asked by the lecturer and by giving an oral
    presentation in the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering Graded Unit
    project
    ¨ Develop complex, vocationally specific reading skills (eg Electrical Safety, Industrial
    Plant Maintenance etc)
    ¨ Develop report writing skills in a number of units (eg Electrical Power Systems,
    Three Phase Induction Motors etc)
    ¨ Allowing candidates to develop their Communication skills in group work activities
    (eg Communication: Practical Skills, Electrical Safety)
    Numeracy
    ¨ Reinforcing Numeracy and Mathematical skills when teaching electrical
    engineering topics (eg Electrical Machine Principles, Electrical Networks and
    Resonance, Synchronous Machines etc)
    ¨ Reinforcing Using Graphical information skills by use of a range of graphical
    representations (eg Power Electronics, Fundamentals of Control Systems and
    Transducers etc)
    Information Technology
    ¨ Develop Information Technology skills through the application of IT within an
    Electrical Engineering context (eg Control Systems Behaviour, Electrical
    Installation Design: Computer Aided etc)
    Problem Solving Skills
    ¨ Develop Critical Thinking Skills through the application of electrical engineering
    principles and technologies to solve electrical engineering problems
    ¨ Develop Planning and Organisational skills (eg Utilisation of Electrical Energy in
    Buildings, Industrial Plant Maintenance etc)
    ¨ Develop reviewing and evaluation skills through, for example, the review and
    evaluation of the Outcomes of assignments and project work (eg Applications of
    Power Electronics in Electrical Motor Drive Systems, Electrical Standby Systems
    etc)
    Working with Others
    ¨ Develop Working with Others skills through group discussion on the solution to
    electrical engineering problems (eg Electrical Safety — role play scenario: eg
    issuing a Permit to Work, identifying risk factors) and laboratory and project work
    (eg Analogue Electronics: An Introduction, Digital Electronics etc)
    6.3 Assessment
    From the outset of developments the SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team
    recognised the need to have an appropriate assessment strategy in place for the
    SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    awards. Such a strategy was developed and is shown below:
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 33
    Aims
    To ensure that:
    (1) consistent, rigorous and efficient approaches are adopted to the development
    and administration of SQA Advanced Electrical Engineering assessment
    instruments at both Unit and Graded Unit levels, which satisfy nationally
    agreed standards
    (2) the assessment load on candidates and staff is sensible and that assessment
    does not unduly detract from teaching and learning
    (3) as far as possible reliable and rigorous moderation processes are put in
    place in order to ensure that consistent national standards are achieved for
    all SQA Advanced Electrical Engineering assessments
    Objectives
    Listed below are the measures that have been put in place to meet the aims:
    (1) Develop nationally at least one assessment exemplar pack for each
    mandatory unit, which clearly sets out the standards of assessment expected
    in the unit.
    (2) Adopt a holistic approach to unit assessment. The implications of this are as
    follows:
    (i) Assessment instruments will normally be designed only to sample
    knowledge and skills in a unit (this is consistent with the new SQA
    Advanced Unit format).
    (ii) A unit assessment strategy will be adopted, where possible, to produce a
    single assessment instrument for the whole unit. Where this is not
    possible the assessment strategy will seek to ensure that the minimum
    number of assessment instruments required are consistent with
    maintaining agreed national standards.
    (3) While not seeking to be entirely prescriptive with regard to the time spent on
    assessment in each SQA Advanced Unit, over assessment should be
    avoided. Assessment times are clearly stated in the individual unit
    specifications.
    (4) Produce assessment exemplar packs for the two Graded Units. For the
    Graded Unit examination produce at least one sample exam paper to show
    the standards expected in such a paper. Likewise, for the 2 Credit Graded
    Unit Electrical Engineering Project produce a set of materials which clearly
    set out the standards of candidate response required to achieve a Grade A
    and a Grade C.
    (5) Actively encourage centres to work in partnership in producing Graded Unit
    assessment materials, which meet nationally agreed standards reducing, in
    turn, the workload on staff in individual colleges.
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 34
    (6) Ensure that consistent and rigorous internal and external moderation
    procedures operate through both SQA Advanced Unit level and Integrative
    Assessment processes. This places a clear responsibility on both centres
    and the SQA.
    As far as has been practical the above objectives have been adhered to when
    developing assessment exemplar and Graded Unit materials.
    Assessment Loading Grid
    An Assessment Loading Grid showing the type and duration of assessment in each
    unit is shown in Appendix 2. It is hoped that course planners will find this grid
    helpful in timetabling the two awards.
    Assessment Exemplar Materials
    Assessment exemplar packs are in the process of being produced for all
    mandatory units, and the Graded Units in the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
    Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards.
    Graded Unit Assessment Exemplars
    It is recommended that candidates do not sit the Graded Unit examination until the
    end of the SQA Advanced Certificate (1st Year of the SQA Advanced Diploma)
    given the range of units that it draws from. It is recommended that, given the size
    and complexity of the project, that the Graded Unit project is started at the
    beginning of the second year of the SQA Advanced Diploma.
    Formative Assessment
    Formative assessment should be used throughout the delivery of units to reinforce
    learning, build candidates’ confidence and prepare candidates for summative
    assessment.
    6.4 Re-assessment
    The way in which centres reassess candidates is integral to the way they manage
    the award assessment process as a whole. Re-assessment should be subject to
    rigorous internal moderation in exactly the same way as assessment is.
    Candidates may require to be reassessed on only a part of an assessment where
    their evidence has been generated over a period of time and/or a discrete part of
    the unit, such as an Outcome, has been assessed originally. On other occasions in
    may not be possible to reassess candidates on parts of their performance which
    are unsatisfactory. Situations where candidates may have to re-do a whole
    assessment include:
    ¨ assessments which test knowledge and understanding and where it may not be
    possible to extract some of the items for re-assessment purposes
    ¨ where parts of several Outcomes are involved
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 35
    ¨ where a project has been designed as an integral assessment and where there
    is requirement to complete the project as a single complex task
    Re-assessment Opportunities
    Re-assessment should operate in accordance with a centre’s assessment policy
    and the professional judgement of the assessor. SQA advises that there should
    normally be one, or in exceptional circumstances two, re-assessment opportunities.
    Please refer to SQA’s Guide to Assessment and Quality Assurance for Colleges of
    Further Education, August 2003 revisions.
    Developing Alternative Assessments
    The design of original assessments should inform the re-assessment process to a
    large extent, as the original determines the type of assessment instruments used
    and the purpose of the assessment. It is normal practice for centres to build up a
    bank of assessments which can be used in whole or in part for re-assessment
    purposes.
    Assessment writers should always refer to the unit specification when developing
    an alternative assessment to ensure that it is of equal demand to the original
    assessment and that it covers all the necessary criteria. Where candidates have
    not provided satisfactory evidence for knowledge and/or skills items which have
    been sampled, they should be reassessed on a different sample.
    Re-assessing SQA Advanced Graded Units
    Re-assessment of the Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 should be based on an
    alternative examination paper. Re-assessment of Electrical Engineering: Graded
    Unit 2 should normally entail a candidate undertaking a completely new project.
    Where a candidate marginally fails the Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 2 the
    centre may wish to reassess her/him on that part(s) of the performance which was
    unsatisfactory. Such re-assessment would be at the discretion of the centre and
    should be subject to rigorous internal moderation.

    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 36
    7 General information for centres
    7.1 Equality and inclusion
    The unit specifications making up this group award have been designed to ensure
    that there are no unnecessary barriers to learning or assessment. The individual
    needs of learners will be taken into account when planning learning experiences,
    selecting assessment methods or considering alternative evidence.
    Further advice can be found on our website
    www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.
    7.2 Internal and external verification
    All instruments of assessment used within these group awards should be internally
    verified using the appropriate policy within the centre and the guidelines set by SQA.
    External verification will be carried out by SQA to ensure that internal assessment is
    within the national guidelines for these qualifications.
    Further information on internal and external verification can be found in SQA’s Guide to
    Assessment (www.sqa.org.uk).
    7.3 Assessment moderation
    All assessment instruments used within the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
    Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards should be internally moderated,
    including assessment exemplar materials, using appropriate policies within the centre
    and guidelines provided by SQA. This will ensure the validity and reliability of the
    instruments of assessment used within the centre.
    External moderation will be carried out by SQA to ensure that internal assessment is
    within the national guidelines for these qualifications.
    For further information on internal and external moderation refer to the SQA Guide to
    Assessment and Quality Assurance for Colleges of Further Education, August 2003
    revision.
    7.4 Open and Distance Learning
    Advice on the use of open and distance learning is given in individual unit
    specifications. However, where it is used with regard to assessment, planning would
    be required by the centre concerned to ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of
    candidate evidence. Arrangement would be required to be put in place to ensure that
    the assessment or assessments were conducted under the conditions specified in the
    unit specification. For example, in the case of a unit which involved a unit end test a
    centre would have to make arrangements for the test to be conducted under
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 37
    controlled, supervised conditions. Likewise, where a unit involves a practical based
    assessment, a centre would have to make arrangements for candidates to come into
    the centre to undertake the assessment under the conditions specified in the unit
    specification.
    It should be noted that the same requirements as specified in the previous paragraph
    apply where part or all of a unit is delivered online.
    7.5 General information for candidates
    The new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
    Engineering awards have been designed by an expert team of educators and
    industrialists with a view to allowing you to meet the educational requirements to work
    as an electrical incorporated engineer. The two new qualifications contain up-to-date
    and relevant electrical subject content and skills and have also been designed to
    satisfy the new SQA Higher National Design Principles.
    The SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team has designed the two new awards
    so that you will have opportunities to learn and understand the core principles and
    technologies that underpin Electrical Engineering. Learning these will be essential in
    providing you with a platform for tackling many electrical tasks and in allowing you to
    develop a more in-depth knowledge of Electrical Engineering. At the same time
    studying the new SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
    Engineering awards will provide you with opportunities to develop sound practical
    electrical investigation, construction, testing and project skills which are critical to
    being a good electrical technician and/or incorporated engineer.
    As well as studying Electrical subjects you will also take Communication with an
    option to do Information Technology as part of the SQA Advanced Certificate. Good
    Communication skills are essential to understanding technical material, and when
    communicating with others whether on an individual basis or when working as part of
    a team. Information Technology underpins much of the work in Electrical Engineering
    whether this is through computer simulation of electrical and electronic circuits or
    systems or in preparing a written report on the work you have been involved in.
    Opportunities to develop Information Technology knowledge and skills are available in
    a number of units in the SQA Advanced Certificate, but an optional unit on Information
    Technology Applications is also available if you wish to consolidate your skills in this
    area.
    The Communication and Information Technology units are mandatory within the SQA
    Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering award although you will not need to study
    these units if you have already done so as part of the SQA Advanced Certificate.
    There is an additional mandatory core unit in the SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
    Engineering award entitled Business Awareness and Continuing Professional
    Development. This unit will provide you with an awareness of the business pressures
    on modern electrical companies and what strategies they are adopting to meet these
    pressures. The unit will also provide you with the opportunity to develop your own
    career and education action plan for the next five years or so.
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 38
    As already mentioned Electrical Engineering is very much about learning and
    understanding core principles and technologies while also doing practical work such
    as constructing and testing circuits and project work. Thus, while taking the SQA
    Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards
    you can anticipate that the teaching and learning approaches adopted by your
    lecturers will include the following: lecturing, group work, practical electrical and
    electronics work, inspection and testing, computer simulation of circuits and
    installations and project work.
    The Electrical Development Team has ensured that assessments in the two awards
    meet national standards. The two awards have been designed to optimise
    assessment so that sufficient time is available for you to learn the electrical principles
    and technologies and the practical skills that are essential to being a good electrical
    technician and incorporated engineer.
    You can expect to do assessment at individual unit level and at qualification level. At
    unit level, assessment will consist of some form of written end test, or a combination
    of short written test and practical exercise or a purely practical exercise. Your lecturer
    should tell you at the start of the unit what form the unit assessment will take. In
    additional, to unit tests there will also be a 3-hour examination at SQA Advanced
    Certificate level and a 2-credit project at SQA Advanced Diploma level. Both these
    assessments have been designed to allow you to demonstrate your ability to integrate
    knowledge, understanding and skills learned in the two awards as a whole.
    The SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team does not wish to place any artificial
    barriers in the way of potential candidates wanting to study the two awards. However,
    it would be unfair to enrol a candidate into the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
    Advanced Diploma who did not have a realistic chance of successfully achieving
    either or both awards. The SQA Advanced Electrical Development Team would
    therefore recommend that a candidate had one of the following qualifications before
    entering the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
    Engineering:
    (1) One Higher from Physics, Technological Studies or Higher Mathematics and
    at least three Standard Grades 1-2/Intermediate 2 passes including
    Mathematics, Physics/Technological Studies and English.
    (2) A National Certificate in Electrical Engineering or Electronic Engineering.
    (3) Equivalent qualifications or experience to those shown in (1) and (2).
    An SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    award no longer satisfies the full academic requirements to become an incorporated
    engineer (a degree is now required). However, the new SQA Advanced Certificate
    and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards provide a very solid
    platform for candidates to proceed to the advanced stages of a degree programme in
    Electrical Engineering. Ask your lecturer about progression arrangements your college
    has with any universities.
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 39
    7.6 Relationship to other awards
    An SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electronics were
    validated in 2004. Since a number of units are common between SQA Advanced
    Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering and Electronics
    awards candidates will have opportunities to transfer a significant number of units
    between the various awards. More limited opportunities will exist for candidates to
    transfer units between the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in
    Electrical Engineering awards and awards in Mechanical Engineering, Manufacturing
    Systems, Mechatronics, General Engineering and Fabrication and Welding and vice
    versa.
    7.7 Articulation arrangements
    All the universities in Scotland were contacted regarding possible articulation routes
    between the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electrical
    Engineering awards and degree courses offered by the universities. In general terms,
    universities indicated that they will allow candidates with an SQA Advanced Certificate
    to enter the first year of their electrical engineering (or related engineering) degree
    programmes. Candidates with an SQA Advanced Diploma will normally be allowed to
    enter the second year of a degree programme provided they have the unit,
    Mathematics for Engineering 3.
    8 Glossary of terms
    Embedded Core Skills: The assessment evidence for the unit also includes full
    evidence for complete Core Skill or Core Skill components. A learner successfully
    completing the unit will be automatically certificated for the Core Skill. (This depends
    on the unit having been successfully audited and validated for Core Skills
    certification.)
    Finish date: The end of a group award’s lapsing period is known as the finish date.
    After the finish date, the group award will no longer be live and the following applies:
    ¨ Candidates may not be entered for the group award.
    ¨ The group award will continue to exist only as an archive record on the Awards
    Processing System (APS).
    Graded unit: Graded units assess learners’ ability to integrate what they have learned
    while working towards the units of the group award. Their purpose is to add value to
    the group award, making it more than the sum of its parts, and to encourage learners
    to retain and adapt their skills and knowledge. (Note to writer: delete if not applicable
    to product type).
    Lapsing date: When a group award is entered into its lapsing period, the following will
    apply:
    ¨ The group award will be deleted from the relevant catalogue.
    ¨ The group award specification will remain until the qualification reaches its finish
    date, at which point it will be removed from SQA's website and archived.
    SQA Advanced Certificate and Diploma in Electrical Engineering
    Group Award Specification: SQA Advanced Certificate (GP6C 48) and Diploma (GP6D 47) in Electrical Engineering 40
    ¨ No new centres may be approved to offer the group award.
    ¨ Centres should only enter candidates whom they expect to complete the group
    award during the defined lapsing period.
    SQA credit value: The credit value allocated to a unit gives an indication of the
    contribution the unit makes to an SQA group award. An SQA credit value of 1 given to
    an SQA unit represents approximately 40 hours of programmed learning, teaching,
    and assessment.
    SCQF: The Scottish Credit and Qualification Framework (SCQF) provides the national
    common framework for describing all relevant programmes of learning and
    qualifications in Scotland. SCQF terminology is used throughout this guide to refer to
    credits and levels. For further information on the SCQF, visit the SCQF website at
    www.scqf.org.uk.
    SCQF credit points: SCQF credit points provide a means of describing and
    comparing the amount of learning that is required to complete a qualification at a
    given level of the framework. One National Unit credit is equivalent to 6 SCQF credit
    points. One National Unit credit at Advanced Higher and one SQA Advanced Unit
    credit (irrespective of level) is equivalent to 8 SCQF credit points.
    SCQF levels: The level a qualification assigned within the framework is an indication
    of how hard it is to achieve. The SCQF covers 12 levels of learning. SQA Advanced
    Certificates and SQA Advanced Diplomas are available at SCQF levels 7 and 8,
    respectively. SQA Advanced units will normally be at levels 6–9 and graded units will
    be at level 7 and 8. National Qualification Group Awards are available at SCQF levels
    2–6 and will normally be made up of National Units which are available from SCQF
    levels 2–7.
    Subject unit: These contain vocational/subject content and are designed to test a
    specific set of knowledge and skills.
    Signposted Core Skills: These refer to opportunities to develop Core Skills in
    learning and teaching, but are not automatically certificated.

    9 History of changes
    It is anticipated that changes will take place during the life of the qualification, and this section
    will record these changes. This document is the latest version and incorporates the changes
    summarised below. Centres are advised to check SQA Connect to confirm that they are using
    the most up-to-date qualification structure.
    NOTE: Where a unit is revised by another unit:
    ¨ No new centres may be approved to offer the unit which has been revised.
    ¨ Centres should only enter candidates for the unit which has been revised where they
    are expected to complete the unit before its finish date.

    As with the previous SQA Advanced Certificate grid, it is recognised that timetabling in a four block system is not done by every centre. The above grid
    is therefore only a guide indicating the order of delivery of units.
    Centres may wish to spread the delivery of units over more than one block which would allow more units to be delivered in parallel.
    Whichever delivery arrangement is used, it is important to complete the delivery of ALL the SQA Advanced Diploma units over the two years of a full-
    time programme.

    ¨ Components, principles of operation, operational aspects and environmental and
    sustainability factors associated with:
    — tidal based schemes
    — wave based schemes
    — geothermal based schemes
    — waste based technologies
    Evidence Requirements for this Unit
    Outcome 1
    Evidence for the Knowledge and/or Skills in this Outcome will be generated through
    sampling. Each learner will need to provide evidence to demonstrate they can analyse two of
    the four technologies and factors associated with traditional methods of energy production.
    The evidence should be responses to specific questions.
    To ensure that learners will not be able to foresee all the items they will be questioned about,
    a different sample should be used on successive assessment occasions. The new sample
    may contain a maximum of one of the Knowledge and/or Skills used in the previous
    assessment occasion.
    A learner’s response can be judged to be satisfactory where the evidence shows that the
    learner can:
    ¨ Describe the key components of the chosen technology.
    ¨ Explain the principles of operation of the chosen technology.
    ¨ Explain the operational aspects of the chosen technology.
    ¨ Describe the environmental and sustainability factors of the chosen technology.
    ¨ Determine the energy produced using supplied data for the chosen technology.
    Evidence should be generated through a closed-book assessment under supervised
    conditions.
    Outcome 2
    Evidence for the Knowledge and/or Skills in this Outcome will be generated through
    sampling. Each learner will need to provide evidence to demonstrate they can analyse three
    of the seven technologies and factors associated with renewable methods of energy
    production. Each sample should consist of one wind and one hydro technology plus one from
    either solar or biomass. The evidence should be responses to specific questions.
    To ensure that learners will not be able to foresee all the items they will be questioned about,
    successive assessment occasions should contain a different sample. As before, the
    requirement for one wind and one hydro to be included is valid although the choice of which
    wind (onshore or offshore) and which hydro (catchment or pumped storage) may be
    changed. The same solar technology cannot be used on the next assessment occasion. If
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HT1L 48, Energy Technologies (SCQF level 8) 5
    biomass technology was used in the assessment occasion then one of the solar technologies
    must be used on the next assessment occasion
    A learner’s response can be judged to be satisfactory where the evidence shows that the
    learner can:
    ¨ Describe the key components of the chosen technology.
    ¨ Explain the principles of operation of the chosen technology.
    ¨ Explain the operational aspects of the chosen technology.
    ¨ Describe the environmental and sustainability factors of the chosen technology.
    ¨ Determine the energy produced using supplied data for the chosen technology.
    Evidence should be generated through a closed-book assessment under supervised
    conditions.
    Outcome 3
    Evidence for the Knowledge and/or Skills in this Outcome will be generated through
    sampling. Each learner will need to provide evidence to demonstrate they can describe two
    of the four technologies and factors associated with emerging and/or less common
    sustainable methods of energy production. The evidence should be responses to specific
    questions.
    To ensure that learners will not be able to foresee all the items they will be questioned about,
    a different sample of technologies should be used on successive assessment occasions. The
    new sample may contain a maximum of one of the technologies used in the previous
    assessment occasion.
    A learner’s response can be judged to be satisfactory where the evidence shows that the
    learner can:
    ¨ Describe the key components of the chosen technology.
    ¨ Explain the principles of operation of the chosen technology.
    ¨ Explain the operational aspects of the chosen technology.
    ¨ Describe the environmental and sustainability factors of the chosen technology.
    Evidence should be generated through a closed-book assessment under supervised
    conditions.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HT1L 48, Energy Technologies (SCQF level 8) 6
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification:Support notes
    Unit title: Energy Technologies
    Unit Support Notes are offered as guidance and are not mandatory.
    While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional
    design length is 40 hours.
    Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
    This Unit is designed to introduce some of the current and emerging or less common
    technologies used in energy production. Traditional methods (coal, oil, gas and nuclear) and
    renewable methods (wind, solar, hydro and biomass) will be described in terms of principle of
    operation, system components, operational aspects and environmental and sustainability
    factors. Emerging and less common technologies (tidal, wave, geothermal and waste) will be
    described in terms of principle of operation, system components, operational aspects and
    environmental and sustainability factors.
    Outcome 1
    It is suggested that the following technologies be used in the delivery of this Outcome:
    Coal: Pulverised coal combustion (PCC)
    Gas: Combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)
    Oil: Crude oil combined cycle
    Nuclear: Pressurised water reactors (PWR)
    For each of the four technologies, diagrams should be used showing the key components in
    the energy conversion process from input through to output. Each stage in the process
    should be explained in terms of its function/operation. Operational aspects should include
    typical overall plant efficiencies, start-up time, utilisation for base or peak loads, reliability of
    supply and CO2 emissions per Unit of energy generated (gCO2/kWh). Environmental and
    sustainability factors and the significance of each will vary depending on the technology but
    would typically include several of the following:
    ¨ Use of finite fossil fuels
    ¨ CO2 released into atmosphere
    ¨ Visual amenity and noise impacts
    ¨ Air, land and water pollution
    ¨ Impact on wildlife and ecological systems
    ¨ Health and safety
    ¨ Waste products
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HT1L 48, Energy Technologies (SCQF level 8) 7
    Outcome 2
    For each of the technologies, diagrams should be used showing the key components in the
    energy conversion process from input through to output. Each stage in the process should be
    explained in terms of its function/operation. Operational aspects should include typical overall
    plant (or Unit) efficiency, weather constraints, logistics (for offshore wind), reliability of supply
    and CO2 emissions per Unit of energy generated (gCO2/kWh). Environmental and
    sustainability factors and the significance of each will vary depending on the technology but
    would typically include several of the following:
    ¨ Use of renewable resources
    ¨ CO2 released into atmosphere
    ¨ Visual amenity and noise impacts
    ¨ Air, land and water pollution
    ¨ Land-loss (large hydro schemes in particular)
    ¨ Impact on wildlife, marine life and ecological systems
    ¨ Waste products
    Outcome 3
    Marine (wave and tidal) technologies are expected to contribute to the future energy ‘mix’. At
    present, worldwide there are only a few operational marine power plants. Technologies to
    harness energy from the tide include tidal barrage and tidal stream. The European Marine
    Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney is one of the world’s leading marine technology research
    and testing centres and a useful source of information. Currently, there are several types of
    wave energy technologies at various stages of development. In the UK, examples include the
    ‘Pelamis’ attenuator system, the ‘Limpet’ oscillating water column system and the ‘Oyster’
    oscillating wave surge convertor system. Energy production from geothermal sources utilises
    three main technologies and currently the US is the largest producer of geothermal energy.
    Historically, energy from waste has been via incineration however more recent technologies
    such as gasification and pyrolysis are now being commissioned. It is suggested that the
    following technologies be used in the delivery of this Outcome:
    Tidal: Tidal barrage and Tidal stream
    Wave: Attenuator systems, Oscillating water column systems and Oscillating wave
    surge convertor systems
    Geothermal: Dry steam, Flash steam and Binary cycle
    Waste: Incineration and Advanced Thermal Treatments (Gasification and Pyrolysis)
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HT1L 48, Energy Technologies (SCQF level 8) 8
    For each of the technologies, diagrams should be used showing the key components in the
    energy conversion process from input through to output. Each stage in the process should be
    explained in terms of its function/operation. Operational aspects should include typical overall
    plant (or Unit) efficiency (where data is available), logistics (for waste), reliability of supply
    and CO2 emissions per Unit of energy generated (gCO2/kWh). Environmental and
    sustainability factors and the significance of each will vary depending on the technology but
    would typically include several of the following:
    ¨ Use of renewable/sustainable resources
    ¨ CO2 released into atmosphere
    ¨ Visual amenity and noise impacts
    ¨ Air, land and water pollution
    ¨ Impact on wildlife, marine life and ecological systems (tidal barrage in particular)
    ¨ Waste products
    Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
    This Unit should be delivered in year 2 of an SQA Advanced Diploma programme. It would
    be beneficial if learners had previously completed the level 7 Unit Energy Overview. It is
    unlikely that it could be delivered through integration with other Units.
    It would be beneficial if learners had classroom internet access. It is suggested that an equal
    amount of time be allocated to each Outcome.
    Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
    Evidence can be generated using different types of assessment. The following are
    suggestions only. There may be other methods that would be more suitable to learners.
    All Outcomes should be assessed on a sample basis.
    Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
    ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
    assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
    work or further and higher education.
    The Unit may be assessed on an Outcome by Outcome basis or through a combination of
    Outcomes.
    Outcome 1
    This Outcome may be assessed individually or in combination with Outcomes 2 and/or 3.
    Evidence should be generated through a closed-book assessment under supervised
    conditions.
    Outcome 2
    This Outcome may be assessed individually or in combination with Outcomes 1 and/or 3.
    Evidence should be generated through a closed-book assessment under supervised
    conditions.

    Outcome 3
    This Outcome may be assessed individually or in combination with Outcomes 1 and/or 2.
    Evidence should be generated through a closed-book assessment under supervised
    conditions.
    Opportunities for e-assessment
    E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we
    mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
    such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
    e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
    that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
    regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
    e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at
    www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
    Opportunities for developing Core and other essential skills
    Some Core Skills may be developed through the delivery of this Unit.
    Information and Communications Technology (ICT) may be developed in all Unit Outcomes
    and in particular, the use of the internet to search for flowcharts, block diagrams and
    animations associated with each of the technologies.
    Numeracy may be developed in Outcomes 1 and 2 in relation to the determination of energy
    output.

    General information for learners
    Unit title: Energy Technologies
    This section will help you decide whether this is the Unit for you by explaining what the Unit
    is about, what you should know or be able to do before you start, what you will need to do
    during the Unit and opportunities for further learning and employment.
    The Unit is designed to introduce a range of technologies associated with energy production.
    The technologies will be classified as traditional, renewable, and emerging and less common
    sustainable methods, for the purposes of this Unit. Traditional (existing) methods are based
    upon fossil fuel technologies and nuclear. Renewable methods are based upon the utilisation
    of non-fossil fuel based technologies. Emerging and less common sustainable methods are
    based upon technologies that are currently at various stages of development, implementation
    or operation together with technologies that are operational but are, overall, small energy
    producers relative to traditional and renewable methods.
    The Unit is optional for learners on related SQA Advanced Engineering Awards. It could also
    be used as a stand-alone Unit where appropriate. No prior knowledge is required although it
    would be beneficial if learners have previously completed the level 7 Unit Energy Overview
    and were familiar with using the internet for research purposes.
    Outcome 1 has been designed to introduce traditional methods of energy production using
    coal, gas, oil and nuclear fuel sources. Typical power plant operation and processes will be
    explained detailing energy input through to energy output. Operational aspects,
    environmental and sustainability issues and numerical calculations pertaining to each
    technology will also be considered.
    Outcome 2 has been designed to introduce renewable methods of energy production using
    wind, hydro, solar and biomass technologies. Typical power plant or device operation and
    processes will be explained detailing energy input through to energy output. Operational
    aspects, environmental and sustainability issues and numerical calculations pertaining to
    each technology will also be considered.
    Outcome 3 has been designed to introduce emerging and/or less common sustainable
    methods of energy production. Tidal, wave, geothermal and waste technologies will be
    considered. Typical power plant or device operation and processes will be explained
    detailing energy input through to energy output. Operational aspects and environmental and
    sustainability issues pertaining to each technology will also be considered.
    In order to achieve this Unit, all Outcomes must be achieved. This Unit will be assessed by
    responses to structured questions under closed-book conditions.
    There is no automatic certification of Core Skills or Core Skill components in this Unit.
    The Unit has been designed to support articulation routes to degree programmes and also to
    support employment opportunities in the energy sector.SQA Advanced Unit Specification

    Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
    This Unit provides core mathematical principles and processes which underpin much of the
    studies undertaken in a number of SQA Advanced Qualifications across a range of
    engineering disciplines. It is recommended that the Unit be delivered towards the beginning
    of these awards.
    Centres may deliver the Outcomes in any order they wish, it is recommended that Outcome
    1 is delivered first followed by Outcomes 2 and then Outcome 3.
    It is recommended that Unit delivery is principally undertaken using a didactic approach. All
    teaching input should be supplemented by a significant level of formative assessment in
    which learners are provided with opportunities to develop their knowledge, understanding
    and skills of the mathematical topics covered in the Unit. Computer software and computer
    algebra may be used to support learning (eg to confirm the solutions of mathematical
    problems), but it is strongly recommended that such learning resources are only used in a
    supportive capacity and not as the principal means of delivering Unit content.
    Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
    Evidence can be generated using different types of assessment.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HP48 46 Engineering Mathematics 1 (SCQF level 6) 9
    A recommended approach is the use of an examination question paper. The question paper
    should be composed of an appropriate balance of short answer, restricted response and
    structured questions.
    All assessment papers should be unseen by learners prior to the assessment event and at all
    times, the security, integrity and confidentiality of assessment papers must be ensured.
    Assessment should be conducted under closed-book, controlled and invigilated conditions.
    The questions in the examination should not be grouped by Outcome or be labelled in terms
    of the Outcomes they relate to when a single end-of-Unit examination is used.
    The summative assessment of all three Outcomes — whether individually or at a single
    assessment event — should not exceed two hours. When assessing a learner’s responses to
    summative assessment lecturers should concentrate principally on the candidate’s ability to
    apply the correct mathematical technique and processes when solving problems. Candidates
    should not be penalised for making simple numerical errors. An appropriate threshold score
    may be set for the assessment of this Unit. A threshold score should be used for each
    assessment if Outcome level assessment is used.
    Learners should be provided with a formulae sheet appropriate to the content of this Unit
    when undertaking their assessment. Computer algebra should not be used in the
    assessment of this Unit.
    It is the learner’s responsibility to ensure that any calculator they use during assessment are
    not designed or adapted to offer any of the following facilities:
    ¨ language translators
    ¨ symbolic algebra manipulation
    ¨ complex number manipulation
    ¨ communication with other machines or the internet.
    In addition, any calculator used by learners should have no retrievable information stored in
    them. This includes:
    ¨ data banks
    ¨ dictionaries
    ¨ mathematical formulae
    Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
    ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
    assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
    work or further and higher education.
    Opportunities for e-assessment
    E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we
    mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
    such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
    e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
    that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
    regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
    e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at www.sqa.org.uk/e-
    assessment.

    HP49 47 Engineering Mathematics 2 (SCQF level 7) 8
    Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
    This Unit provides core mathematical principles and processes which underpin much of the
    studies undertaken in a number of SQA Advanced Qualifications across a range of
    Engineering disciplines. It is recommended that the Unit be delivered towards the beginning
    of these awards.
    Centres may deliver the Outcomes in any order they wish, it is recommended that Outcome
    1 is delivered first followed by Outcomes 2 and then Outcome 3.
    It is recommended that Unit delivery is principally undertaken using a didactic approach. All
    teaching input should be supplemented by a significant level of formative assessment in
    which learners are provided with opportunities to develop their knowledge, understanding
    and skills of the mathematical topics covered in the Unit. Computer software and computer
    algebra may be used to support learning (egto confirm the solutions of mathematical
    problems), but it is strongly recommended that such learning resources are only used in a
    supportive capacity and not as the principal means of delivering Unit content.
    Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
    Evidence can be generated using different types of assessment.
    A recommended approach is the use of an examination question paper. The question paper
    should be composed of an appropriate balance of short answer, restricted response and
    structured questions.
    All assessment papers should be unseen by learners prior to the assessment event and at all
    times, the security, integrity and confidentiality of assessment papers must be ensured.
    Assessment should be conducted under closed-book, controlled and invigilated conditions.
    The questions in the examination should not be grouped by Outcome or be labelled in terms
    of the Outcomes they relate to when a single end-of-Unit examination is used.
    The summative assessment of all three Outcomes — whether individually or at a single
    assessment event - should not exceed two hours. When assessing a learner’s responses to
    summative assessment lecturers should concentrate principally on the learner’s ability to
    apply the correct mathematical technique and processes when solving problems. Learners
    should not be penalised for making simple numerical errors. An appropriate threshold score
    may be set for the assessment of this Unit. A threshold score should be used for each
    assessment if Outcome level assessment is used.
    Learners should be provided with a formulae sheet appropriate to the content of this Unit
    when undertaking their assessment. Computer algebra should not be used in the
    assessment of this Unit.
    It is the learners’ responsibility to ensure that any calculator they use during assessment are
    not designed or adapted to offer any of the following facilities:
    ¨ language translators
    ¨ symbolic algebra manipulation
    ¨ symbolic differentiation or integration
    ¨ communication with other machines or the internet
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HP49 47 Engineering Mathematics 2 (SCQF level 7) 9
    In addition, any calculator used by learners should have no retrievable information stored in
    them. This includes:
    ¨ databanks
    ¨ dictionaries
    ¨ mathematic formulae
    Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
    ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
    assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
    work or further and higher education.
    Opportunities for e-assessment
    E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we
    mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
    such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
    e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
    that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
    regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
    e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at
    www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
    Opportunities for developing Core and other essential skills
    This Unit has the Using Number component of Numeracy embedded in it. This means that
    when candidates achieve the Unit, their Core Skills profile will also be updated to show that
    they have achieved Using Number at SCQF level 6.

    Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
    This Unit provides many of the core mathematical principles and processes required when
    studying Engineering at a more advanced level. Given the nature of the subject matter in the
    Unit it is advisable that the Unit is not delivered until learners have studied Engineering
    Mathematics 3.
    Centres may deliver the Outcomes in any order they wish.
    The Unit may be delivery using a didactic approach. All teaching input should be
    supplemented by a significant level of formative assessment in which learners are provided
    with opportunities to develop their knowledge, understanding and skills of the mathematical
    topics covered in the Unit. Alternatively, as learners taking this Unit may be preparing to
    enter an degree course at university (possibly at an advanced level) the Unit could be
    delivered as a series of lectures supported by tutorial sessions to help learners prepare
    better for future university studies.
    Computer software and computer algebra may be used to support learning (eg to confirm the
    solutions of mathematical problems), but it is strongly recommended that such learning
    resources are only used in a supportive capacity and not as the principal means of delivering
    Unit content.
    Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
    The recommended approach is the use of an examination question paper. The question
    paper should be composed of an appropriate balance of short answer, restricted response
    and structured questions. The questions in the examination should not be grouped by
    Outcome or be labelled in terms of the Outcomes they relate to.
    All assessment papers should be unseen by the learners prior to the assessment event and
    at all times, the security, integrity and confidentiality of assessment papers must be ensured.
    Assessment should be conducted under closed-book, controlled and invigilated conditions.
    The summative assessment of all four Outcomes should not exceed two hours. When
    assessing a learner’s responses to summative assessment lecturers should concentrate
    principally on the learner’s ability to apply the correct mathematical technique and processes
    when solving problems. Learners should not be penalised for making simple numerical
    errors. An appropriate threshold score may be set for the assessment of this Unit.
    Learners should be provided with a formulae sheet appropriate to the content of this Unit
    when undertaking their assessment. Computer algebra should not be used in the
    assessment of this Unit.

    It is the learners’ responsibility to ensure that any calculator they use during assessment are
    not designed or adapted to offer any of the following facilities:
    ¨ language translators
    ¨ symbolic algebra manipulation
    ¨ symbolic differentiation or integration
    ¨ communication with other machines or the internet
    In addition, any calculator used by learners should have no retrievable information stored in
    them. This includes:
    ¨ databanks
    ¨ dictionaries
    ¨ mathematic formulae
    Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
    ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
    assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
    work or further and higher education.
    Opportunities for e-assessment
    E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we
    mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
    such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
    e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
    that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
    regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
    e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at
    www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
    Opportunities for developing Core and other essential skills
    This Unit has the Using Number component of Numeracy embedded in it. This means that
    when candidates achieve the Unit, their Core Skills profile will also be updated to show that
    they have achieved Using Number at SCQF level 6.

    Engineering (eg ac electrical circuits). You will also learn to apply matrix techniques which
    are particularly useful when, for example, solving systems of linear equations containing
    several variables. You will develop the knowledge, understanding and skills to use Taylor’s
    and MacLaurin’s series to represent functions, and finally you will be introduced to a range of
    techniques for solving an important class of equations known as first order differential
    equations which arise extensively in many areas of Engineering.
    Unit delivery may comprise of a significant teaching input from your lecturer supplemented by
    tutorial exercises which will allow you to develop the knowledge, understanding and skills to
    apply the mathematic principles and processes covered in the Unit to a range of Engineering
    problems. Alternatively, in order to prepare you for studies at university the centre where you
    are taking this Unit may choose to deliver it as a series of lectures supported by tutorials.
    Formal assessment will be through an examination. Assessment will be conducted under
    closed-book, controlled and invigilated conditions.

    Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
    This Unit provides many of the core mathematical principles and processes required when
    studying engineering at a more advanced level. Given the nature of the subject matter in the
    Unit it is advisable that the Unit is not delivered until learners have studied Engineering
    Mathematics 4.
    Centres may deliver the Outcomes in any order they wish.
    The Unit may be delivery using a didactic approach. All teaching input should be
    supplemented by a significant level of formative assessment in which learners are provided
    with opportunities to develop their knowledge, understanding and skills of the mathematical
    topics covered in the Unit. Alternatively, as learners taking this Unit may be preparing to
    enter an degree course at university (possibly at an advanced level) the Unit could be
    delivered as a series of lectures supported by tutorial sessions to help learners prepare
    better for future university studies.
    Computer software and computer algebra may be used to support learning (eg to confirm the
    solutions of mathematical problems), but it is strongly recommended that such learning
    resources are only used in a supportive capacity and not as the principal means of delivering
    Unit content.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HT1N 48, Engineering Mathematics 5 (SCQF level 8) 10
    Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
    The recommended approach is the use of an examination question paper. The question
    paper should be composed of an appropriate balance of short answer, restricted response
    and structured questions. The questions in the examination should not be grouped by
    Outcome or be labelled in terms of the Outcomes they relate to.
    All assessment papers should be unseen by the learners prior to the assessment event and
    at all times, the security, integrity and confidentiality of assessment papers must be ensured.
    Assessment should be conducted under closed-book, controlled and invigilated conditions.
    The summative assessment of all four Outcomes should not exceed two hours and thirty
    minutes. When assessing a learner’s responses to summative assessment lecturers should
    concentrate principally on the learner’s ability to apply the correct mathematical technique
    and processes when solving problems. Learners should not be penalised for making simple
    numerical errors. An appropriate threshold score may be set for the assessment of this Unit.
    Learners should be provided with a formulae sheet appropriate to the content of this Unit
    when undertaking their assessment. Computer algebra should not be used in the
    assessment of this Unit.
    It is the learners’ responsibility to ensure that any calculator they use during assessment are
    not designed or adapted to offer any of the following facilities:
    ¨ language translators
    ¨ symbolic algebra manipulation
    ¨ symbolic differentiation or integration
    ¨ communication with other machines or the internet
    In addition, any calculator used by learners should have no retrievable information stored in
    them. This includes:
    ¨ databanks
    ¨ dictionaries
    ¨ mathematic formulae
    Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
    ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
    assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
    work or further and higher education.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HT1N 48, Engineering Mathematics 5 (SCQF level 8) 11
    Opportunities for e-assessment
    E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we
    mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
    such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
    e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
    that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
    regardless of the mode of gathering evidence.
    The most up-to-date guidance on the use of e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is
    available at www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
    Opportunities for developing Core and other essential skills
    This Unit has the Using Number component of Numeracy embedded in it. This means that
    when candidates achieve the Unit, their Core Skills profile will also be updated to show that
    they have achieved Using Number at SCQF level 6.

    is about, what you should know or be able to do before you start, what you will need to do
    during the Unit and opportunities for further learning and employment.
    The Engineering Mathematics 5 Unit is one of a suite of five Units in Mathematics developed
    for SQA Advanced Certificates and Diplomas across a range of Engineering disciplines. The
    five Units help develop the mathematical skills required for workplace roles and for more
    advanced studies in Engineering, for example, articulation to degree study at university.
    The Unit is optional in a number of SQA Advanced Diplomas in Engineering.
    This Unit is designed to develop the mathematical skills required by learners who wish to use
    their SQA Advanced Diploma in Engineering to articulate to university degree study.
    You will learn a range of techniques for solving second order differential equations. These
    equations arise frequently in many areas of engineering. You will develop the knowledge,
    understanding and skills to perform partial differentiation and double integration. You will also
    learn about the very powerful Laplace Transforms method for solving a wide range of
    differential equations. You will also be introduced to eigenvalues and eigenvectors which are
    used in the solution of linear system equations.
    Unit delivery may comprise of a significant teaching input from your lecturer supplemented by
    tutorial exercises which will allow you to develop the knowledge, understanding and skills to
    apply the mathematic principles and processes covered in the Unit to a range of engineering
    problems. Alternatively, in order to prepare you for studies at university the centre where you
    are taking the Engineering Mathematics 4 Unit may choose to deliver it as a series of
    lectures supported by tutorials.
    Formal assessment will be through an examination. Assessment will be conducted under
    closed-book, controlled and invigilated conditions.
    Learners considering taking this Unit will normally be expected to have passed the
    Engineering Mathematics 3 SQA Advanced Unit or equivalent. It also recommended that you
    have passed the Engineering Mathematics 4 SQA Advanced Unit.sed theHT1R 47, Fundamentals of Control Systems and Transducers (SCQF level 7) 1

    Evidence Requirements for Outcomes 1-3
    Written and/or Oral recorded evidence is required for outcomes 1-3 which will be provided
    on a sample basis. In any assessment of the Outcomes three out of five Knowledge and/or
    Skills items should be sampled from Outcome 1, two out of three Knowledge and/or Skills
    items from Outcome 2, and four out of seven Knowledge and/or Skills items from
    Outcome 3.
    In order to ensure that learners will not be able to foresee what items they will be questioned
    on, a different sample of three out of five Knowledge and/or Skills items from Outcome 1, two
    out of three Knowledge and/or Skills items from Outcome 2, and four out of seven
    Knowledge and/or Skills items from Outcome 3 is required each time the Unit is assessed.
    Learners must provide a satisfactory response to all items.
    Evidence should be generated through assessment undertaken in controlled, supervised
    conditions. Assessment should be conducted under closed-book conditions and as such
    learners must not be allowed to bring any textbooks, handouts, manuals or notes to the
    assessment.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HT1R 47, Fundamentals of Control Systems and Transducers (SCQF level 7) 5
    Where sampling takes place, a learner’s response can be judged to be satisfactory where
    the evidence shows the learner can:
    Outcome 1

    HT1R 47, Fundamentals of Control Systems and Transducers (SCQF level 7) 6
    Evidence Requirements for Outcome 4
    This is a practically based Outcome and all of the Knowledge and/or Skills items should be
    assessed. The evidence should be presented in response to a practical, laboratory
    assignment in which each learner is set the task of constructing and demonstrating the
    operation of a circuit or system that incorporates a transducer.
    A learner’s response can be judged to be satisfactory where evidence provided is sufficient
    to meet the requirements for each item by showing that the learner is able to:
    ¨ Construct and demonstrate correct operation of a circuit or system that incorporates a
    transducer
    ¨ Describe the operation of the circuit or system that has been constructed
    ¨ Measure and plot on a graph, the transducer’s output in response to changes at its input
    Evidence of the practical aspects of this assignment should be recorded by centres in the
    form of a checklist for each learner. Each learner is required to construct a circuit or system
    independently, and then demonstrate to the Assessor its correct operation. If the learner’s
    circuit or system does not operate properly, then the learner should be allowed to correct the
    faults and retest the operation at the same assessment event.
    On completion of the practical laboratory exercise, learners are required to submit a written
    laboratory report. This report should include the following sections of information:
    ¨ purpose of the circuit or system, and relevant circuit or system diagram
    ¨ brief description of method of construction
    ¨ description of operation of the circuit or system
    ¨ record of measured input and output values for the transducer
    ¨ graph of transducer’s transfer characteristic (o/p versus i/p values)
    ¨ record of observations of the operation of the circuit or system
    ¨ analysis of recorded values, graph and observations
    ¨ conclusion conveying the success of the operation of the circuit or system
    Centres should provide learners with details of the required report format. Although it should
    be encouraged, it is not a requirement that learners use software packages to produce
    documentation for their reports. Centres should make every reasonable effort to ensure that
    each report is the learner’s own work.
    The circuit or system that the learner is required to construct and demonstrate can be built
    using discrete components, pre-constructed modules or a combination of both. Learners
    should be issued with the circuit or system diagram along with a brief description of its
    purpose. The circuit or system should be constructed in the laboratory under controlled,
    supervised conditions, and the written report can be completed outwith the laboratory in the
    learner’s own study time.

    While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional
    design length is 40 hours.
    Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
    This Unit has been written to in order to allow learners to develop knowledge, understanding
    and skills in the following areas:
    1 Explain control system elements and signals.
    2 Explain the operation and application of a range of transducers used in control systems.
    3 Describe the structure and behaviour of control systems.
    4 Demonstrate the application of transducers in control systems.
    This Unit is at SCQF level 7 and is included within the SQA Advanced Certificate in
    Electronics and SQA Advanced Diploma in Electronics. However this does not preclude the
    use of this Unit in other awards where award designers feel this to be appropriate.
    In designing this Unit, the Unit writer has identified the range of topics expected to be
    covered by lecturers. The writer has also given recommendations as to how much time
    should be spent on each Outcome. This has been done to help lecturers decide what depth
    of treatment should be given to the topics attached to each of the Outcomes. Whilst it is not
    mandatory for centres to use this list of topics, it is recommended that they do so since the
    assessment exemplar pack for this Unit is based on the Knowledge and/or Skills and list of
    topics in each of the Outcomes.
    A list of topics for each Outcome is given below. Lecturers are advised to study this list in
    conjunction with the assessment exemplar pack so that they can get a clear indication of the
    standard of achievement expected of learners in this Unit.

    measuring variables such as temperature, flow, displacement, velocity, pressure, strain,
    position, level and light.
    Examples of devices that could be covered are potentiometers, capacitive displacement
    transducers, tacho-generators, strain gauges, flow meters, manometers, bourdon tubes,

    (with respect to peak, overshoot, settling time, steady state error etc.)
    ¨ Throughout this Outcome, practical illustrative examples of control systems should be
    available in the laboratory to allow learners the opportunity to observe their operation
    and obtain some ‘hands on’ experience. These could be actual or model control systems
    that allow the learners to observe and analyse the effects of gain changes, input
    condition changes etc.
    4 Demonstrate the application of transducers in control systems (6 hours)

    incorporate transducers
    ¨ Measure the output of transducers in response to changes in the input quantity
    ¨ Plot the transfer characteristics for transducers (graphs of output values versus input
    values)
    ¨ From the graphs identify any non-linear characteristics and hysteresis
    The circuits and systems can be built using discrete components, pre-constructed modules,
    or a combination of both.

    Throughout the delivery of this Unit, reference should be made to practical examples of
    control systems. A range of transducers should be available for learners to view. Practical
    demonstrations and/or laboratory exercises showing the operation of transducers and model
    control systems should be provided throughout the Unit.
    This Unit has been developed as part of the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA Advanced
    Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards. Where this Unit is incorporated into other Group
    Awards it is recommended that it be delivered in the context of the specific occupational
    area(s) that the award is designed to cover.
    Details on approaches to assessment are given under Evidence Requirements and
    Assessment guidelines under each Outcome in the SQA Advanced Unit specification:
    statement of standards section. It is recommended that these sections be read carefully
    before proceeding with assessment of learners.
    The written assessment paper should take place after delivery of the Unit is complete.
    The practical laboratory assignment can be carried out during the delivery of the Unit.
    Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
    Evidence can be generated using different types of assessment. The following are
    suggestions only. There may be other methods that would be more suitable to learners.
    Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
    ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
    assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
    work or further and higher education.
    The assessment for all Outcomes 1, 2 and 3 in this Unit should be combined together into
    one written assessment paper. This paper should be taken by learners at one single
    assessment event that should last two hours. The assessment paper should be composed of
    a suitable balance of short answer, restricted response and structured questions. This
    assessment should be carried out at the end of the delivery of the Unit and be conducted
    under controlled, supervised conditions.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HT1R 47, Fundamentals of Control Systems and Transducers (SCQF level 7) 11
    Outcome 4 should be assessed by a practical, laboratory assignment in which each learner
    is set the task of constructing and demonstrating the operation of a circuit or system that
    incorporates a transducer. On successful completion of the practical aspects of this
    assignment, learners should be required to submit a written laboratory report. The time that
    should be allocated in the laboratory for this assignment is 2 hours. However, learners
    should be allowed to complete the written report outwith the laboratory in their own study
    time. The assessment for Outcome 4 should be carried out at a suitable time during the
    delivery of the Unit.
    Assessment Guidelines
    Outcomes 1-3
    The assessment for Outcomes 1, 2 and 3 should be combined together to form one
    assessment paper. This single assessment paper should be taken at a single assessment
    event lasting two hours and be carried out under supervised, controlled conditions. Such a
    paper should be composed of an appropriate balance of short answer, restricted response
    and structured questions. This assessment should be taken at the end of the Unit.
    Outcome 4
    The assessment of this Outcome should take the form of a practical, laboratory assignment
    which can be carried out at a suitable time during the delivery of the Unit. The time that
    should be allocated in the laboratory for this assignment is 2 hours. However, learners
    should be allowed to complete the written report outwith the laboratory in their own study
    time. It is recommended that centres develop checklists to support the assessment
    requirements for each of the Knowledge and/or Skills items.
    It is essential that centres ensure that evidence generated is the learner’s own work. Centres
    can choose to issue each learner with the same circuit or system to be constructed, or a
    different circuit or system to be constructed. If different circuits or systems are issued then
    each one must possess the same degree of difficulty.
    Opportunities for e-assessment
    E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we
    mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
    such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
    e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
    that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
    regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
    e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at
    www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.

    General information for learners
    Unit title: Fundamentals of Control Systems and Transducers
    (SCQF level 7)
    This section will help you decide whether this is the Unit for you by explaining what the Unit
    is about, what you should know or be able to do before you start, what you will need to do
    during the Unit and opportunities for further learning and employment.
    A control system consists of a number of components (which can be electrical, mechanical,
    thermal or hydraulic) that act together to maintain a desired output in a process. Control
    systems are used extensively in industries such as oil refining, electrical generation,
    chemical processing, and manufacturing and production. Our homes and offices also use
    control systems to regulate temperature and air conditioning. This Unit has been designed to
    enable you to develop the necessary knowledge and skills so you to understand the structure
    and general behaviour of different types of control systems.
    The Unit takes a non-mathematical approach to control systems. You will learn how to
    explain control system concepts, use block diagrams to model systems, and use graphical
    methods to describe their behaviour.
    You will begin the Unit by learning about the types of component parts that make up control
    systems. You will also learn how information is transferred between the component parts by
    means of analogue and digital signals. You will discover that the operation of a control
    system is heavily influenced by its environment, and that the choice of equipment and signal
    types depends on the location of the system. The need for signal conditioning devices such
    as filters and amplifiers will be covered.
    As you progress through the Unit, you will learn about different methods of controlling the
    output of a process. Basic methods such as open loop control will be covered. However,
    these have limitations and disadvantages. Therefore, you will learn about the need for closed
    loop control systems which have the facility to measure the output variable being controlled,
    so as to sense changes and enable corrective action to be taken to ensure that the output of
    the system is maintained at the desired value. Such control systems include temperature
    control and flow control of liquids. You will also develop knowledge and skills to enable you
    to understand how controllers can be used to modify the way open and closed loop control
    systems respond (with respect to speed of response, damping, and transient and steady
    state response).
    Closed loop control systems incorporate devices called transducers. These accept energy in
    one form eg heat and produce output energy in some other form such as an electrical signal.
    You will study the operation and application of a range of transducers suitable for measuring
    variables such as temperature, flow, displacement, velocity, pressure, strain, position, level
    and light. In addition, you will have the opportunity to construct circuits and systems that
    incorporate transducers. You will measure the characteristics of transducers, and study the
    overall operation of the circuits and systems that you build.
    By the end of this Unit you should possess the knowledge and skills to enable you to: explain
    control system elements and signals; explain the operation and application of a range of
    transducers; describe the structure and behaviour of control systems; and demonstrate the
    application of transducers in control systems.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HT1R 47, Fundamentals of Control Systems and Transducers (SCQF level 7) 15
    The formal assessment for the Unit will consist of a both a written assessment paper lasting
    two hours and a laboratory assignment lasting two hours.
    The written assessment paper will be conducted under closed-book conditions and you will
    not be allowed to take notes, textbooks etc into the assessment. You will sit this assessment
    paper at the end of the delivery of the Unit.
    The laboratory assignment will require you to construct and demonstrate the operation of a
    circuit or system that incorporates a transducer. This will be carried out during a two hour
    laboratory session at a suitable time during the delivery of the Unit. On successful completion
    of the practical aspects of this assignment, you will be required to submit a written laboratory
    report.

    board. Candidates may be provided with subprograms to configure and read/write input/output ports.
    This Unit was developed as one of four SQA Advanced Certificate/Diploma in Engineering
    Programming options and is at SCQF level 7. This Unit should be completed before tackling the level
    8 Unit, High Level Language: External I/O Transfer.
    The Unit has identified the topics that are expected to be covered by lecturers. The Unit also gives
    recommendations as to how much time should be spent on each Outcome. This has been done to help
    lecturers to decide what depth of treatment should be given to the topics attached to each of the
    Outcomes. Whilst it is not mandatory for a centre to use this list of topics it is strongly recommended
    that they do so to ensure continuity of teaching and learning across the Engineering Computing Units
    and because the assessment exemplar pack for this Unit is based on the Knowledge and/or Skills and
    list of topics in each of the Outcomes.
    A list of topics is given below. Lecturers are advised to study this list in conjunction with the
    assessment exemplar pack for this Unit so they can get a clear indication of the standard of
    achievement expected of candidates taking the Unit.

    Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
    This is the first engineering programming Unit on the SQA Advanced Certificate/Diploma Electronics
    and for many candidates this may be their first encounter with programming. In this respect it may be
    advisable to deliver this Unit on a free-standing basis.
    Each candidate should have access to a computer loaded with appropriate OS and High Level
    Language software. Additionally workstations should be available on which candidates are able to test
    I/O based programs.
    Delivery of all the Outcomes may be carried out using an LCD projector so that the candidates can
    view the actual code of the sample programs and see their execution with prepared test data in real
    terms.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    Unit HP41 47: High Level Engineering Software 10
    This introductory Unit should be used to develop the candidate’s confidence in the basic
    programming concepts and as such should be taken before considering assembly language
    programming.
    It is suggested that the Unit assessment take the form of a logbook or portfolio covering the four
    Outcomes.
    For example, assuming a two-hour class per week, then over a 20-week period the assessment
    schedule may be:
    Weeks 1 to 5 Linear programming
    Outcome 1 assignments completed (2hours)
    Weeks 6 to 10 Non-linear programming for I/O ports using selection statements
    Outcome 2 assignments completed (2hours)
    Weeks 11 to 15 Non-linear I/O programming using iterative loops
    Outcome 3 assignments completed (2hours)
    Weeks 16 to 20 I/O programming using bit-wise operations
    Outcome 4 assignments completed (4hours)
    Open learning
    This Unit is more suitable for laboratory delivery however it could be delivered by distance learning
    provided the candidate has the appropriate hardware. This may require some degree of on-line
    support. However, with regard to assessment, planning would be required by the centre concerned to
    ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence. Arrangements would be required to be
    put in place to ensure that assessment whether done at a single or at multiple events was conducted
    under controlled, supervised conditions.
    To keep administrative arrangements to a minimum, it is recommended that a single assessment paper
    (taken by candidates at a single assessment event) be used for distance learning candidates.
    Equality and inclusion
    This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to
    learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when
    planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative
    evidence.

    This unit provides a solid basis on which further IT skills can be built. It will enable learners to
    use IT systems with minimal support, paying due regard to security. Electronic data sources
    are to be used, learners are expected to achieve effective results when using IT software in
    an unfamiliar context by using on-line help facilities and suppliers’ handbooks. Basic
    configuration and fault-finding skills are to be taught. Files should be provided for learners as
    appropriate to negate the need for them to enter large amounts of text or data.
    This unit is very much aimed at enabling learners to obtain and use data and software
    applications packages associated with the internet and email, ie electronic communications.
    Therefore, there should be considerable emphasis placed upon providing access to
    appropriate data and software associated with electronic communications. Candidates
    should then be encouraged to learn for themselves the benefits of being able to integrate
    information from diverse sources and produce documents, designs, compositions, models or
    presentations of a complex nature.
    The unit can be approached from the standpoint of using information technology to support a
    range of information processing activities. The learner should be able to plan for, develop
    and produce the relevant information requirements of users.
    Candidates should achieve the level of competence required of a regular user of IT
    applications software in a commercial or professional situation. Candidates will require
    individual access to a personal computer/workstation. It is suggested that, wherever
    possible, commercially available current versions of industry standard software be used. The
    component parts of an integrated software package along with its operating environment can
    be used to achieve all Outcomes. This should not be prohibitive in the case of the centres,
    but may be an issue if being undertaken in the workplace.
    It is generally assumed that the environment for this unit will be, for example, Microsoft
    Windows and Office 97/2000 or Lotus, or other vendor equivalents, however, this is not
    specified and the Outcome requirements are deliberately generic in nature.
    Outcome 1 looks at the components of hardware, the functions of operating system tools and
    how these are used. Data security measures, resolving common hardware and software
    problems are also pre-eminent. All of the elements should be taught in the context of giving
    attention to the needs of other users of a computer system.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HP6L 47, Information Technology: Applications Software 1 (SCQF level 7) 6
    Outcome 2 looks at using a range of software packages to meet complex information
    requirements. Centres can choose four or more packages (a minimum of four different
    packages must be used) from the whole range of applications packages available. The
    software application packages chosen must be relevant to the vocational area of the Group
    Award undertaken by the learner. The emphasis in this Outcome should be on producing
    complex information in a context that is unfamiliar to the learner. Candidates should be able
    to integrate data types, (eg text, number, graphics, audio, video) into a single product and to
    format the product so that the final output is clear and helpful to users. Candidates should
    show that they can plan for the information requirements; select and use software packages
    appropriate to information requirements; select suitable computer data sources for
    information and extract suitable information from these computer data sources to meet
    relevant requirements.
    An indication of the range of activities that learners are expected to be able to carry out when
    using a variety of software applications packages during the course of this unit is given below
    for some of the ‘standard’ applications that centres may use. This should not be taken to be a
    ‘prescriptive’, or indeed, an exhaustive list of requirements but should help to serve as a
    guide to the level of skills required.
    1 Selection and use of appropriate software applications packages and electronic data
    sources from both local and remote computers.
    2 Selection and use of document layout, page layout and format facilities, eg: views, use
    of toolbars, rulers, guides, zoom, fonts, bullets and numbering, borders and shading,
    tabs, case, dropped capitals, columns, themes, backgrounds, styles, frames, colours
    and lines, alignment, templates, auto-format.
    3 Use of on-line help and tutorial support facilities.
    4 File Handling, eg properties, naming conventions, saving, saving for use with web and
    other applications, retrieving, retrieving from web and other applications, copying,
    renaming, importing, exporting, emailing, attachments, routing, and faxing.
    5 Editing, eg undo, repeat, cut, copy, paste, paste special, select all, fill, clear, find,
    replace, go to, rename, links, and objects.
    6 Selection and use of insertions, eg headers and footers, page breaks, comments,
    footnotes, captions, numbering, symbols, date and time, index and tables, bookmarks,
    pictures, objects, hyperlinks, graphics, movies, sounds, tables, queries, forms and
    reports, functions, charts, comments, fields, records and files.
    7 Use of ‘tools’, eg spelling and grammar checker; thesaurus; search and replace; auto-
    correction; sort; merge; customisation; options; security; protection; macros (simple); on-
    line facilities; send and receive; address books, synchronisation, message rules,
    messenger services, newsgroups and accounts.
    8 Printing, eg printer selection; printer properties; printer set up, eg paper size, paper type,
    scaling, orientation, etc; print preview; use of print preview facilities, eg zoom, multiple
    pages, ruler, scaling, etc.
    9 Searching should involve several criteria, eg key terms or fields, and requires decisions
    to be made about an effective strategy for their application, eg with due regard for time,
    cost, effective filtering and result.
    10 Extracting and presenting relevant information - relevant data may be records in a
    database, a photographic image, a video or audio clip. Selection/importation may involve
    tools such as screen grabbers, digital or video cameras and scanners.
    This unit is designed to enable students to use IT systems and applications independently to
    support a range of information processing activities. The unit is designed to develop a
    knowledge of the theoretical concepts, principles, boundaries and scope of IT applications.
    These activities will be centred on using several software application packages to meet
    complex information requirements.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification

    Instrument of assessment
    There are two Outcomes, both largely of a practical nature.
    Outcome 1: Prove Knowledge and/or Skills of: the different components of a computer
    system, the function of tools such as file manager, print manager and control panel, the ways
    in which data can be kept secure and the causes of common software and hardware
    problems and how to resolve them.
    Outcome 2: Uses a range of software application packages, (at least four) to meet complex
    information requirements. The learners will be given a comprehensive checklist of all
    evidence required to successfully complete this Outcome. They will then have to create a
    technical manual and player guide indicating on the checklist exactly where each
    requirement has been met. Given the complexity of the technical manuals and user guides
    shipped with today’s games, this should make for a demanding, but hopefully enjoyable
    experience.
    Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
    This unit is designed to enable learners to use IT systems independently to support a range
    of information processing activities. Early inclusion of this unit in the Group Award is
    preferable as students should then be able to present work for other Units using the skills
    learned in this unit.
    During the course of the unit learners should have several opportunities to develop their
    practical skills and should then be assessed appropriately.
    Assessment should be by one project or case study. Candidates should have access to on-
    line help, tutorial support and/or suppliers’ manuals as required.
    Individual centres will need to plan Outcome 2 to ensure that such resources as the internet
    service provider, compact discs, available telephone lines, modems, software application
    packages and operating systems updates are available prior to commencement of the unit.
    If this unit is being delivered as part of a Professional Development Award which receives
    endorsement from a vendor such as Microsoft, it must be delivered and evidence generated
    as detailed in the document ‘Approval to certification’ which is associated with that particular
    vendor and the Professional Development Award.
    Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
    Evidence can be generated using different types of assessment. The following are
    suggestions only. There may be other methods that would be more suitable to learners.
    Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
    ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
    assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
    work or further and higher education.
    Outcome 2
    The emphasis in this Outcome should be on producing complex information in a context
    which is unfamiliar to the learner. Centres may wish to complete an observation checklist to
    keep track of the learner’s development in the use of the four chosen software applications
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HP6L 47, Information Technology: Applications Software 1 (SCQF level 7) 8
    packages. The software application packages chosen must be relevant to the vocational
    area of the Group Award undertaken by the learner.
    Opportunities for e-assessment
    E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this unit. By e-assessment we
    mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
    such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
    e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
    that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
    regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
    e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at
    www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
    Opportunities for developing Core and other essential skills
    This unit gives automatic certification of the core skill: Using Information Technology at
    SCQF level 6.

    logging and retrieval, control or other packages.
    On successful completion of the unit you will be able to:
    1 Operate a range of IT equipment independently, giving attention to security and to other
    users.
    2 Use a range of software packages to meet complex information requirements.
    In Outcome 1 you will learn about the components of hardware, the functions of operating
    system tools and how these are used. You will also learn about data security measures and
    resolving common hardware and software problems. You will learn about all of the elements
    above in the context of meeting the needs of all users of a computer system.
    In Outcome 2 you will learn about how to use a range of software packages to meet complex
    information requirements. You will learn about a minimum of four different software packages
    from the whole range of applications packages available. The emphasis in this Outcome will
    be on producing complex information in a context that is unfamiliar to you. You will learn how
    to integrate data types, (eg text, number, graphics, audio, video) into a single product and to
    format the product so that the final output is clear and helpful to users. You will find out how
    to: plan to meet users’ information requirements; select software packages appropriate to
    information requirements; select suitable computer data sources for information and extract
    suitable information from these computer data sources to meet relevant user requirements.
    To complete this unit successfully, you must demonstrate a satisfactory level of performance
    in a number of tasks covering the Outcomes listed above. You must provide evidence of the
    work you carry out for each assessment task in the form of a set of printed documents with a

    Context for delivery:. This Unit was developed for the SQA Advanced Certificate and SQA
    Advanced Diploma in Electrical Engineering awards. If this Unit is delivered as part of another
    group award, it is recommended that it should be taught and assessed within the subject area of the
    group awards to which it contributes.
    Assessment: The assessment for Outcomes 1, 2 and 3 of this Unit should be combined together
    into one written assessment paper. This paper should be taken by candidates at one single assessment
    event that should last one and a half hours. The assessment paper should be composed of a suitable
    balance of short answer, restricted response and structured questions. This assessment should be
    conducted under controlled, supervised conditions
    Outcome 4 will be assessed by practical exercises, the evidence being recorded using an observation
    checklist, the production of a short report and the completion of standard test result sheets and an
    inspection report during the testing procedures. The completion of documentation is extremely
    important in this Unit and all assessments should be based on the IEE Certificates for Inspection,
    Testing and Certification of Electrical Systems. These practical exercises should incorporate both a
    visual inspection of an electrical installation, lasting 30 minutes and a series of installation tests along
    with the completion of the required certification. The testing and certification section of the exercise
    should last 60 minutes.
    NOTE: the electrical installation should contain a minimum of two faults which must be found during
    the testing exercise.
    The first assessment (Outcomes 1, 2 and 3) should be carried out after delivery of Outcome 3 and the
    second assessment (Outcome 4) should be carried out at the end of the delivery of this Unit.
    It should be noted that candidates must achieve all the minimum evidence specified for each Outcome
    in order to successfully achieve the Unit.

    all circuits on a standard test results sheet and to complete a periodic inspection report.
    Safe working practice must be observed throughout the inspection and testing procedure.
    Written evidence should be produced to show the candidate’s ability to explain the technical data
    requirements to enable testing and inspection to take place and to outline the safe isolation procedure
    which will be implemented prior to the testing procedures taking place.
    A candidate’s response can be judged to be satisfactory where evidence provided is sufficient to meet
    the requirements for each item by showing that the candidate is able to:
    ¨ Explain the technical data requirements to enable testing and inspection to take place correctly.
    ¨ Demonstrate a safe isolation procedure on a simulated electrical installation.
    ¨ Perform an inspection of the simulated electrical installation
    ¨ Perform the listed tests on a simulated electrical installation
    ¨ Complete the schedules of testing results and a periodic inspection report
    Evidence should be generated through assessment under controlled, supervised conditions.
    Assessment should be conducted under closed-book conditions and, as such, candidates must not be
    allowed to bring any textbooks, handouts or notes to the assessment. Candidates will be provided
    with current codes of practice, BS7671 or other relevant legislative documentation for use during the
    assessment.
    Assessment guidelines
    Outcome 4 should be assessed by practical testing exercises on a simulated electrical installation
    rig(s).
    Evidence of the candidate’s ability to carry out the inspection and testing procedures should be
    recorded using observation checklists.
    The candidate will also be required to complete the standard test result sheet and an inspection report
    which should include identification of the two fault condition results.
    A report, of approximately 400 words plus diagrams, charts etc, along with completion of a ‘Periodic
    Inspection Report for and Electrical Installation’
    (Appendix 6, BS7671), should be produced by the candidate to show his/her ability to explain the
    technical data requirements to enable testing and inspection to take place and to outline the safe
    isolation procedure which will be implemented prior to the testing procedures taking place.

    In designing this Unit, the unit writer has identified the range of topics expected to be covered by
    lecturers. The writer has also given recommendations as to how much time should be spent on each
    Outcome. This has been done to help lecturers decide what depth of treatment should be given to the
    topics attached to each of the Outcomes. Whilst it is not mandatory for centres to use this list of
    topics, it is recommended that they do so since the assessment exemplar pack for this Unit is based on
    the knowledge and/or skills and list of topics in each of the Outcomes.
    A list of topics for each Outcome is given below. Lecturers are advised to study this list in
    conjunction with the assessment exemplar pack so that they can get a clear indication of the standard
    of achievement expected of candidates in this Unit
    1 Explain the general requirements for the inspection and testing of an electrical
    installation during its normal life-cycle. (10 hrs)
    This Outcome should provide candidate with an understanding of the general requirements for
    inspection and testing of an electrical installation when it is newly installed, the periodicity of re-
    inspecting and testing and the action that should be taken if alterations or additions are made. The
    requirements of part seven of BS7671 provided the technical foundation for developing the subject
    and the IEE guidance notes on Inspection and Testing (ISBN 0-85296-991-0) develop the regulations.
    ¨ Safety
    ¨ Required competence
    ¨ The Client
    ¨ Record keeping
    ¨ Purpose of initial verification
    ¨ Frequency of subsequent installations
    ¨ Initial inspection
    Consideration should also be given to the following:
    Electrical installation: TN-S; TN-C-S; TT. Nominal voltage 230V and 400V; rating of over current
    protective devices at the origin of the installation not to exceed 100A; work environment is domestic;
    commercial and light industrial.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    Unit (HV2L 47): Inspection and Testing of Low Voltage Electrical Installations 9
    Initial Inspection: connection and identification of conductors; cable routing; current carrying
    capacity; voltage drop; connection of control devices; connection of accessories; equipment; fire
    barriers; methods of protection against electric shock; labelling, presence of notices; erection
    methods; presence of under-voltage protection; adequate access to switchgear and equipment;
    protection methods for direct and indirect contact; adequate earthing arrangements; selection of
    equipment and protective measures appropriate to external influences; position of devices for
    isolation and switching location.
    Reasons for periodic testing and inspection; legislative requirements; verification of continued
    compliance with BS7671; change of ownership or tenancy of premises; alterations or additions to
    existing installation to change electrical loading.
    2 Explain the recommended tests to verify the integrity of an electrical installation (10 hrs)
    This Outcome should provide the candidate with an understanding of why the tests are being carried
    out; the requirements that have to be met to satisfy part seven of BS7671 and the methods of tests that
    are to be performed.
    The Outcome should provide candidates with an understanding of why it is necessary to know the
    value of the prospective short circuit current and the external earth loop impedance and also provide
    an explanation of how to approach the measurement of these.
    ¨ Purpose of periodic inspection and testing
    ¨ Necessity for periodic inspection and testing
    ¨ Initial testing
    Electrical installation: TN-S; TN-C-S; T.T. Systems
    Tests: Continuity of protective conductors main and supplementary bonding, continuity of ring final
    circuit conductors; insulation resistance; polarity tests; earth electrode resistance; earth fault loop
    impedance; operation of residual current devices; measurement of characteristics of supply at the
    origin of the circuit.
    3 Explain the requirements and precautions for testing electrical installations (10 hrs)
    This Outcome should provide the candidate with an understanding of why safety documentation is
    essential before work is carried out in organisations that specify permits-to-work and sanction-to-test
    documents as part of their safety policy. The responsibility of the electrical contractor to comply
    with safety procedures and the delegation of authorised signatories by the company to the contractor,
    for safety documents, should be discussed. The need to recognise that intrinsically safe instruments
    are required in installations designated as hazardous should be emphasised. Reference only is
    required to the zoning of areas and the types of environment where more specialist testing
    consideration is necessary.
    Relevant requirements of the Health and Safety at Work Act and the Electricity at Work Regulations
    in an industrial environment, where additional hazards may be present, permits-to-work and
    sanctions-for-test.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    Unit (HV2L 47): Inspection and Testing of Low Voltage Electrical Installations 10
    Requirements: instrument accuracy; field and instrument errors; routine calibration and checking of
    low resistance ohmmeter; insulation resistance ohmmeter; applied voltage tester; earth fault loop
    impedance testers; earth electrode, test sets; RCD Testers.
    4 Carry out appropriate testing procedures which conform to British Standard
    requirements (10 hrs)
    This Outcome should provide the candidate with the opportunity to prepare for inspection and testing
    and carry out inspection and testing.
    The centre will require a simulated test rig(s) to enable the tests specified in the range statement to be
    carried out effectively. It is recommended that the rig(s) should be supplied from a three-phase
    isolator and feed a single-phase distribution board from which lighting circuits and power circuits are
    supplied. A three phase motor circuit should be provided for. A residual current device or devices
    should be included in the design. The design of the rig or rigs is not critical providing all the tests
    can be performed effectively. Different rigs can be used to cover the complete range of tests.
    Observation checklists are required for each of the tests. The candidate should be given the
    necessary work instructions to carry out the testing. A selection of the necessary hand tools and a
    range of test instruments should be provided. During the test the candidate will be expected to record
    all relevant information and tests results for all circuits on an appropriate results sheets; safe working
    practice must be observed throughout the inspection and testing procedure.
    Technical data: available diagrams; charts; previous test results for inspection; test
    certificates; general characteristics of installation; access to design data (new installation).
    Isolation procedure: isolate; lock off; issue permit-to-work; complete permit documentation; test for
    dead.
    Test of external earth loop impedance and prospective short circuit current (PSCC); protective
    conductors continuity: continuity of ring final circuit conductors; insulation resistance; polarity;
    Earth fault loop impedance; earth electrode resistance; operation of residual current devices
    A candidate-centred learning approach is recommended. Underpinning theory should be reinforced
    by use of short testing exercises where a hands-on-approach should be encouraged. Throughout the
    Unit the importance of accurate documentation should be stressed. Safety procedures and practices
    should be observed at every stage of the unit.

    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 1
    1 Introduction
    This Arrangements Document has been written in order to assist centres in
    preparing for approval of the new HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards
    and maintaining the awards thereafter. These two awards were developed under the
    new SQA Design Principles, were validated in March2005, and replace the existing
    HNC Engineering: Electrical and the HND Engineering: Electrical.
    This Document includes details on the background to the development of the new
    awards, their aims (both general and specific), recommended access requirements,
    information about the structure of the awards, recommendations on delivery and
    assessment and other guidance for centres.
    2 Rationale for the Revisions of the Awards
    2.1 Electrical Engineering
    The term Electrical Engineering in the context of this document covers the range of
    subjects traditionally included in SQA Higher Nationals in Electrical Engineering,
    namely power, plant and electrical installation. The title Electrical Engineering is
    intended to provide candidates, lecturers, Higher Education, employers and
    professional bodies with a clear, unambiguous title.
    Electronics has not been included in the HNC and HND Electrical Engineering titles
    as only sufficient electronics has been included in both awards to underpin studies in
    the various branches of electrical engineering.
    2.2 HN Engineering Frameworks
    In 1996 the SQA validated nationally a large number of new HN Engineering
    awards including two awards entitled HNC Engineering: Electrical and HND
    Engineering: Electrical. A major difference between these and previous awards were
    that they all sat within an HN Engineering Framework which in general terms
    consisted, for both HNCs and HNDs, of a common core of Units (Units common to
    all HNC and HND Engineering awards), a principles/technology and optional
    sections. The benefits of this Framework structure were seen to include the
    following:
    ¨ provide a wide range of HN Engineering qualifications to meet the needs of
    different engineering sectors
    ¨ improve the credibility and esteem of individual HN Engineering awards
    ¨ clarify those competencies that were general to all incorporated engineers and
    those that were specific to particular engineering disciplines
    ¨ provide opportunities for the efficient delivery of HN Engineering Units by, for
    example, incorporating Units that were common to a number of different HN
    awards
    ¨ facilitate better progression between HNC, HND and Degree engineering
    awards
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 2
    Prior to the development of any HN Engineering awards a major consultation
    exercise was undertaken on the overarching HN Engineering Framework to test the
    validity of the Framework. This consultation comprised of the following five
    strands:
    ¨ a questionnaire survey with stakeholders of HN Engineering awards
    ¨ a series of meetings with various interested stakeholders of HN Engineering
    awards
    ¨ desk based research
    ¨ discussions (followed by endorsement) of a proposed HN Engineering
    Framework at a HN Engineering Steering Group meeting
    ¨ a major consultation event with FE colleges on 24 May 2002 which included a
    questionnaire survey
    The consultation revealed continuing strong support for an overarching HN
    Engineering Framework but with the following modifications:
    ¨ a reduction in the number of common core Units
    ¨ a strengthening of the Principles/Technology section with an even stronger
    emphasis on the teaching of core engineering principles and technologies
    Optional sections are retained in all HNC and HND Engineering awards.
    The revised HNC and HND Engineering Frameworks are shown in block diagram
    form in Figures 2.1 and 2.2. It should be noted that the PDAs shown in both
    diagrams may be developed as more HN Units come on stream; currently none of
    these PDAs exist.

    2.3 History and Market Research to support the HNC and HND
    Electrical Engineering
    2.3.1 History of the HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards
    The introduction of the SCOTVEC Advanced Courses Development Programme
    lead to the replacement of the 132 HND in Electrical and Electronic Engineering
    award by a competence based HND in Electronic and Electrical Engineering in
    1989. Shortly after an HNC in Electronic and Electrical Engineering was introduced
    as part of a national development and replaced the 101 HNC in Electrical and
    Electronic Engineering. However, there continued to be little commonality between
    the new HNC and HND awards. The first attempt to harmonise the two awards took
    place as part of a consortium development in the early nineties. In 1995 and 1996
    the two awards were totally harmonised (eg the HNC Electrical becoming
    effectively the first year of the HND) as part of a major SCOTVEC national
    development which saw the introduction of an overarching HN Engineering
    Framework. The two new awards represent a further development of Higher
    National Engineering awards taking full account the new HN Design Principles and
    providing an opportunity to update the awards in light of technological and
    educational developments.
    2.3.2 Market Research
    The development of the new HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards included
    extensive market research which is summarised below in Table 2.3.
    Stakeholder Method
    All Major desk based research gathering and analysing data
    from various sources (eg SEMTA, FutureSkills Scotland
    etc.)
    Delivery Centres Initial postal survey of all delivery centres followed by
    two National seminars.
    Draft Units, assessment exemplars and outlines of
    graded Units were made available to centres.
    Employers Surveys of employers were carried out at the
    commencement of the development of the two awards
    and when the two award structures and Units were
    nearing finalisation. Information obtained from
    employers helped to inform both structure and Unit
    development
    Higher Education Letters of support for articulation between the new HNC
    and HND Electrical Engineering and Degree awards
    were received from seven Higher Education institutions.
    Professional Bodies The Chair of the Institute of Incorporated Engineers was
    a member of the Validation Panel and provided a broad
    measure of support for the two new developments at the
    Validation Event which was later confirmed in writing.

    2.4 Candidates
    2.4.1 HNC Candidates
    Candidates at HNC level may already be in employment and will attend centres on a
    day-release or other part-time basis. The HNC framework structure is flexible
    enough to allow centres to deliver the HNC award by various modes of delivery for
    example, two-year day-release, evening attendance etc.
    The options chosen by employed candidates may reflect the branch of industry in
    which they are employed or may be used to gain knowledge of other areas within
    electrical engineering in order to improve their career opportunities in the
    employment market. Part-time candidates may also use the HNC award to gain
    entry to Degree level studies.
    Full-time HNC candidates may be school leavers intending to articulate to a
    University Degree Course, or candidates who wish to progress from an appropriate
    National Certificate qualification. Full-time candidates may also be more mature
    persons who are seeking a change of employment.
    Since the HNC award forms an integral part of the HND award, full-time candidates
    will complete 15 Unit credits in the first year of the course, 12 of these meeting the
    HNC requirements. Full-time candidates will therefore have completed the first year
    of the HND programme and may, if they wish, continue to the second year of the
    HND award.
    In addition to University entrance, successful full-time HNC candidates have
    enhanced their prospects of gaining employment in the Electrical Engineering
    industry.
    2.4.2 HND Candidates
    The HND award programme will normally be delivered on a two-year full-time
    basis, although this does not preclude other delivery patterns. This being the case,
    HND candidates may be school leavers who have an interest in some aspect of
    electrical engineering and wish to include this in their career path. This may be
    candidates who wish to progress from an appropriate National Certificate
    qualification or candidates who have previously completed the HNC award and
    wish to progress to the HND. The typical HND candidate will therefore be a young
    person intending to articulate to a University Degree Course. The Units of the
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 7
    HNC/D framework have been designed to introduce candidates to electrical
    engineering and to take topics to a more advanced level than is possible in the HNC.
    Mature candidates may also embark on the HND programme. The HN Electrical
    Development Team and Unit writers were aware that such candidates may not
    have studied for some time and will require additional support in developing
    their learning skills. The HN Electrical Units have been designed as far as
    possible to provide candidates with opportunities to develop critical knowledge
    and understanding of theory and practical hands-on skills required by practising
    electrical incorporated engineers.

    3.5 How the General Aims are met in the HNC and HND Award Structures and Content
    Aim No How it is met in HNC and HND
    3.1.1 For many years HNC and HND Electrical Engineering qualifications have equipped candidates to seek employment in a wide
    range of manufacturing, service and public sector organisations. Market research indicates that HNC and HND Electrical
    Engineering awards are still regarded as the minimum qualifications required by many organisations to work at electrical
    technician or incorporated engineer level.
    3.1.2 There has been a long tradition of candidates in employment taking HNC Electrical and Electronic awards on a part-time basis to
    increase their knowledge of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and enhance their career development. In recent years, with
    increased commonality between HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards and greater flexibility in the way these awards are
    delivered, candidates in employment have increasingly taken HNDs on a part-time basis to expand their knowledge and skills in
    Electrical and Electronic Engineering and improve their career prospects. The two new awards contain a balance of core
    principles and up to date knowledge and skills in Electrical Engineering which lends themselves to the Continuous Professional
    Development and career development of candidates working at electrical technician and incorporated engineer levels.
    Furthermore, the award structures have been designed to allow for easy progression between HNC and HND awards.
    3.1.3 All Units within the new HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards have been levelled at SCQF levels 6, 7 or 8. The two new
    awards also conform to the SQA levelling requirements for HNC and HND awards. Thus, successful completion of one or both
    awards will allow progression within the SCQF.
    3.1.4 The nature of Electrical Engineering as a discipline lends itself to both the analysis and synthesis of problems. For example, when
    a complex electrical and electronic system is analysed (using, say, a block diagram approach) by breaking it down into separate
    functional parts or alternatively the synthesis of a complex system from simpler electrical and electronic systems. The two new
    awards allow these important skills to be developed further both in the technical subjects and in the core Communication,
    Information Technology ands Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development Units.
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 11
    Aim No How it is met in HNC and HND
    3.1.5 The new HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards provide centres with an opportunity to enhance learning skills not least by
    creating opportunities for candidates to combine theory and practice to achieve a real understanding of a subject. For example,
    some Units recommend significant use of practical work and/or computer simulation to reinforce learning. It is also anticipated
    that centres will use innovative delivery approaches that may make use of sophisticated electrical and electronic laboratory
    equipment and/or on-line delivery and/or Virtual Learning Environments to enhance candidate learning.
    By their very nature Engineering courses require the transfer of technical knowledge and skills form one area to another. For
    example, a significant level of Electrical Principles and Mathematics has been included in both HNC and HND Electrical
    Engineering awards because these subjects provide underpinning knowledge, understanding and skills which are used elsewhere
    in both awards. Candidates will also have an opportunity to use the Communication and Information Technology knowledge and
    skills developed in the mandatory core Units in other parts of the awards to support such activities as report writing, presentation
    and the application of specialist software packages. Core skills in general, and problem solving in particular, have been regarded
    as very important by the HN Electrical Development Team since it is recognised that a good level of competence in these is
    essential in the work of an incorporated electrical technician.
    3.3.1 The double credit (16 SCQF points) Engineering Project Graded Unit in the HND Electrical Engineering award provides
    opportunities for candidates to develop both their planning and project management knowledge and skills.
    3.3.2 The Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development Unit provides candidates with the opportunities to develop
    their investigative skills by exploring the external and internal factors that affect the performance of a modern company and the
    different ways that people learn. The Engineering Project also requires candidates to undertake some investigations into the
    background to and a range of solutions for their engineering project.

    3.6 How the Specific Aims are met in the HNC and HND Award Structures and Content
    Aim No How it is met in HNC and HND
    3.2.1 An HNC and HND Electrical Engineering award has been recognised for many years by employers and other stakeholders of
    these awards as appropriate qualifications for persons wishing to work at electrical technician or senior technician levels. Market
    research indicates that there is a growing demand for people with technician level skills in electrical and electronic engineering
    especially as companies automate a lot more of their processes. Thus, it is confidently anticipated that those achieving the HNC
    and HND Electrical Engineering awards will find employment as electrical technicians and incorporated electrical engineers in a
    wide range of small, medium and large companies.
    3.2.2
    &
    3.2.3
    An HNC or HND no longer satisfies fully the academic requirements for Incorporated Engineer status although these
    qualifications continue to completely satisfy Engineering Technician requirements. The minimum qualification for Incorporated
    Engineer is an ordinary Degree.
    Given the clear progression routes that have been established between existing HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards and
    Degree courses by many FE colleges and universities, it is strongly anticipated that similar progression routes will also be
    developed between the new HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards and Degree courses. Thus, HNC and HND Electrical
    Engineering awards will continue to form very important ‘stepping stones’ towards candidates achieving Degrees (and, thus,
    satisfy fully the academic requirements for Incorporated Engineer status). Progression arrangements between HNCs, HNDs and
    Degrees can only be strengthened with the full implementation of the SCQF. Seven letters have been received from Scottish
    Universities confirming articulation arrangements between the new HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards and Degree
    programmes.

    Aim No How it is met in HNC and HND
    3.2.4 The current HNC and HND Engineering awards contain separate Communication and Information Technology Applications
    Units within their mandatory cores. The market research information gathered through various consultations indicates that there
    continues to be solid support for the inclusion of a distinct Communication Unit in the mandatory core of the HNC and a
    Communication and Information Technology Units within the mandatory core of the HND Engineering award. The benefit of
    having separate Communication and Information Technology Units is that it significantly improves the prospect of sufficient
    attention being given to the teaching of these two key subjects. Separate Units also make it possible to ensure that the
    Communication and Information Technology core skills at Higher level are fully embedded within the respective Units within the
    HND. Award designers considered this a more appropriate way to ensure that these core skills are included in HN Engineering
    awards than trying to embed such core skills across, say, a range of engineering Units, except at HNC level where they believe
    there is considerable opportunities to develop Information Technology Core Skills within Electrical Units. A number of
    respondents to various surveys have expressed their concerns about Communication and Information Technology not being seen
    as relevant by candidates because they are not delivered and assessed within an engineering context. The HNC/D Electrical
    Development Team has addressed this concern by supporting the production of Communication and Information Technology
    assessment exemplar materials specifically contextulised to engineering.
    3.2.5 Market research shows that employers place a high priority on employees having the correct technical and practical skills to
    function effectively in their job. Whilst there continues to be a debate about the precise nature of such technical and practical
    skills it is clearly important that electrical technicians and incorporated engineers have a sound knowledge and understanding of
    core electrical principles. Such knowledge and understanding will serve candidates well in employment and provide the platform
    for learning more advanced technical skills. The Mandatory section of the new HNC Electrical Engineering award reflects this
    concentration on core principles by providing studies in the key areas of Electrical Engineering namely: electrical principles,
    electrical power systems, electrical machine principles and electrical safety. The HN Electrical Development Team also took the
    view that a knowledge and understanding of Mathematics is fundamental to the work of electrical technicians and has included a
    Mathematics Unit (containing the Using Number component of the Core Skill Numeracy at Higher level) within the Mandatory
    section of the HNC Electrical Engineering award. The inclusion of Mathematics within the Mandatory section was widely
    supported during various consultation processes.
    3.2.6 The correct use of electrical and electronic instruments is very important to electrical technicians and incorporated engineers. The
    Electrical Development Team regard such skills as so important that it has included a Unit on the use of electrical and electronic
    instruments in the Mandatory section of the HNC.

    3.2.7 In the 2-credit optional section candidates will be able to specialise further in the following areas: Electrical Principles,
    Information Technology, Three Phase Induction Motors, Power Electronics, Inspection and Testing of Low Voltage Electrical
    Installations, Programmable Logic Controllers, Electrical Systems in Hazardous Environments, Control Systems, further
    Mathematical studies, Electrical Installation Skills and Quality Management. The HN Electrical Development Team strongly
    recommends that candidates with little or no practical electrical experience take the Electrical Installation Skills Unit as
    part of their optional studies. Analysis of candidate uptake of Units in the optional section of the current HNC Engineering:
    Electrical award revealed that many Units had low entry numbers. The HN Electrical Development Team took the view that
    given the resources available for Unit development purposes, efforts should be concentrated on the development of optional Units
    where there was a reasonable confidence of high candidate uptake. This explains why there are only a limited number of Units in
    the optional section. Consultation with the FE sector and other stakeholders has indicated that the choice of Units in the optional
    section is correct. One advantage of limiting the number of optional Units is that more attention has been given to these Units
    resulting, in the view of the Development Team, in better quality Unit specifications.
    The HN Electrical Development Team does not preclude additional Units being added to the optional section especially where
    demand for such Units can be demonstrated.
    3.2.8 The Communication Core Skill at Higher level has been incorporated into the HNC Electrical Engineering award through the
    mandatory Unit, Communication: Practical Skills. There was strong support for the inclusion of the Numeracy core skill at
    Higher within both HNC and HND Engineering awards. The Electrical Development Team has adopted the Unit Mathematics for
    Engineering 1: Electronics and Electrical (taken from the HNC and HND Electronics awards). The Core Skill component Using
    Number at Higher is embedded in this Unit. Opportunities to develop the Core Skills Information Technology, Problem Solving
    and Working with Others are signposted within individual Unit specifications. Candidates may achieve the Information
    Technology and Working with Others Core Skills at Higher level if they take the optional Units in Information Technology:
    Applications Software 1 in the HNC and Employment Experience 2 within the HND, respectively.

    3.4.3
    It has been traditional to deliver some form of Business Studies Unit in HND Engineering awards looking at issues such as
    costing/pricing of products and services. However, the focus of the new Business Awareness and Continuing Professional
    Development Unit is quite different looking as it does at the changing industrial environment in which incorporated engineers
    have to work nowadays. This environment is characterised by globalisation of the market place leading to world-wide marketing
    opportunities and competitive pressures; greater use of advanced technologies and the predominance of Small and Medium Sized
    Enterprises in the British economy. It is important that HND Engineering candidates are suitably prepared to work in this ever-
    changing employment environment. The Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development Unit seeks to do this by
    allowing candidates to explore the external factors that affect the performance of modern companies and the ways in which
    companies are responding to these external pressures internally. The Unit also has an Outcome on the important role that
    continuous learning and Continuing Professional Development will increasingly play in helping candidates to obtain sustainable
    and rewarding employment. Consultation with the FE sector and other interested stakeholders of HND Engineering awards has
    shown a strong measure of support for the Business Awareness and Continuing Professional Development Unit.
    3.4.4 The Mandatory section of the HND Electrical Engineering award contains all the Units in the Mandatory section of the HNC
    Electrical Engineering award. In addition, within the Mandatory section of the HND Electrical Engineering awards there are
    Units which allow candidates to expand their knowledge, understanding and skills in the key areas of electrical principles,
    electrical machines and systems and electrical installation. The Electrical Development Team has also considered it important to
    build on the mathematical skills developed in the Mathematics for Engineering 1: Electronics and Electrical Unit by including
    another core Mathematics Unit (entitled Mathematics for Engineering 2) within the Mandatory section of the HND award. The
    main subject area of this Unit is Calculus.
    3.4.6 The Communication and Information Technology Core Skills at Higher level have been incorporated into the HND Electrical
    Engineering award through the mandatory core Units Communication: Practical Skills and Information Technology: Application
    Software respectively.
    The component Using Number of the Core Skill Numeracy at Higher is embedded within the Unit Mathematics for Engineering
    1: Electronics and Electrical. The Core Skill Problem Solving at Higher level is embedded within the 2 credit HND Graded Unit.
    Candidates may achieve the Core Skill Working With Others at Higher level if they take the optional Unit Employment
    Experience 2. Opportunities to develop the Core Skill component Using Graphical Information at Higher level are signposted
    within individual Unit specifications.

    5.3 Graded Units
    The purpose of the Graded Unit for both the HNC and HND awards is to assess the
    candidate’s ability to apply and integrate knowledge and/or skills gained within
    individual Units. By this means candidates will demonstrate that they have achieved
    the specific aims of the awards as detailed in Sections 3.2 and 3.4. The Graded Units
    also provide the means by which a candidate’s achievement can be graded.
    HNC Electrical Engineering candidates will undertake a one Credit Graded Unit at
    level 7. This will be in the form of a 3-hour written examination.
    HND Electrical Engineering candidates will also do the HNC Graded Unit but, in
    addition, will undertake a two Credit Graded Unit at level 8. This will take the form
    of a practical assignment/project.
    5.3.1 Types of Graded Units
    HNC Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 — Examination
    It will be noted that the Graded Unit draws on Outcomes in the mandatory section of
    the award which are studied by all HNC Electrical Engineering candidates.
    The assessment for the Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 consists of an
    examination paper which should last three hours.
    It is recommended that candidates do not sit the Graded Unit Examination until the
    end of the HNC (1st Year of the HND), given the range of Units that it draws from.
    HND Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 2 — Project
    The nature of the project activity is such that it is likely that centres will wish their
    candidates to embark on it from the start of the second year of the HND Electrical
    Engineering programme. As it is anticipated that centres will deliver the HNC
    Electrical Engineering as part of the first year of the HND, it is recommended that
    candidates have completed all HNC Electrical Engineering Units, including the
    HNC Graded Unit, before commencing the project.
    In principle, the project can draw on any Units in the HND Electrical Engineering
    framework although the majority of Units should be at SCQF level 8. The project
    can be taken from one Electrical Engineering area (eg Electrical Machines) or it can
    span more than one technical area. However, its principal purpose is not to integrate
    technical content (this is covered in Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1) but
    rather to combine such knowledge and skills as planning, construction, testing,
    evaluating and reporting.
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 22
    5.3.2 Rationale for the Graded Units Assessment
    The assessment methods ie an examination for Graded Unit 1 and a project for
    Graded Unit 2 were decided through consultation with industry and delivering
    centres during initial consultation on the overarching HN Engineering framework
    (see HNC and HND Electronics Validation Document for more details).
    The consultation indicated that an ‘examination’ provided a more accurate way of
    assessing candidates’ abilities to apply and integrate knowledge and understanding
    from various technical and related areas, such as Communication. Furthermore, it
    was considered that during their HNC studies candidates will not normally develop
    fully the necessary knowledge and skills to complete a project.
    A project was preferred at the HND level because a project-based assignment
    provides candidates with opportunities to demonstrate not only their knowledge and
    skills in a technical area(s) but also in areas such as planning, construction, testing,
    evaluating and reporting which are important aims within the HND Electrical
    Engineering award
    5.4 Core Skills
    The HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards have been designed using the
    new HN Design Principles and therefore the importance of core skills has been
    recognised and been incorporated, where appropriate, throughout the awards.

    5.5 Conditions of the Award
    The conditions of award for HNC and HND Electrical Engineering qualifications
    are as follows:
    5.5.1 HNC Electrical Engineering
    A candidate will be awarded HNC Electrical Engineering on successful completion
    of 11 Unit credits plus 1 Graded Unit based on the HNC Electrical Engineering
    award structure shown in Section 5.1. More specifically this award structure
    requires that a candidate achieves the following:
    ¨ the 1 Unit credit Communication: Practical Skills within the mandatory section
    ¨ the remaining eight Unit credits from the mandatory section
    ¨ two Unit credits from the optional section
    ¨ Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 Examination
    5.5.2 HND Electrical Engineering
    A candidate will be awarded HND Electrical Engineering on successful completion
    of 27 Unit credits plus 3 Graded Unit Assessment credits based on the HND
    Electrical Engineering award structure shown in Section 5.2. More specifically this
    award structure requires that candidates achieve the following:
    ¨ the 3 Unit credits Communication: Practical Skills, Information Technology:
    Applications Software 1 and Business Awareness and Continuing Professional
    Development within the mandatory section
    ¨ remaining seventeen Unit credits from the mandatory section
    ¨ seven Unit credits from the optional section
    ¨ Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 and Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit
    2
    5.6 SCQF levels
    Figures 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 show the distribution of SCQF levels in the HNC and HND
    Electrical Engineering awards respectively in the mandatory sections. It can be seen
    from Figure 5.6.1 that all Units in the HNC Electrical Engineering mandatory
    section are at level 7 except for two, the Mathematics for Engineering 1: Electronic
    and Electrical Unit and the Application of Electrical and Electronic Instruments
    Unit, which are both at level 6. The Table shows that the number of SCQF level 7
    Units substantially exceeds the minimum of 48 SCQF credit points required to be in
    an HNC to satisfy the new HN Design Principles.
    From the outset of developments, the HN Electrical Development Team recognised
    that the level of Mathematics achieved by the average candidate entering the current
    HNC Engineering: Electrical award was around Intermediate 2 (Standard Grade
    Credit level) and there was a need to include a SCQF level 6 Mathematics Unit in
    the HNC (and the first year of the HND Electrical Engineering) which consolidated
    candidates’ existing knowledge and understanding of Mathematics particularly in
    the areas of transposing and solving equations and trigonometry, skills that are so
    important in the field of Electrical Engineering.
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 32
    The Application of Electrical and Electronic Instruments Unit was originally
    levelled at SCQF level 7, but was relevelled at SCQF level 6 as a result of the
    validation process.
    As noted above, the HN Electrical Development Team has levelled the remaining
    Units in the mandatory section of the HNC Electrical Engineering at SCQF level 7.
    The HN Electrical Development Team used as their benchmarks for levelling, the
    Highers in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and various NQ Electronic and
    Electrical Engineering Units and their knowledge of the content of existing Degree
    courses in Electronic and Electrical Engineering.
    It can be seen from Figure 5.6.2 that the minimum number of SCQF level 8 Units a
    candidate has to take in the HND Electrical Engineering is 64 SCQF credit points
    which meets the minimum requirement of 64 SCQF credit points as stated in the HN
    Design Principles. However, it is anticipated that most candidates will undertake
    some optional Units at level 8 which will mean that they will comfortably exceed
    this minimum requirement. The case for the two level 6 Units in the HND Electrical
    Engineering has already been presented above. A number of the SCQF Level 8
    Units in the HND follow on from corresponding level 7 Units and are, therefore,
    appropriately levelled at SCQF level 8. The HN Electrical Development Team also
    used their knowledge of existing second year Degree courses to level Units in the
    HND Electrical Engineering award.

    6 Approaches to delivery and assessment
    6.1 Content and context
    Throughout the design and development of the HNC and HND Electrical
    Engineering awards the HN Electrical Development Team has placed a high priority
    on producing awards that allow candidates to develop appropriate technical and
    practical skills. As indicated earlier, it is not possible to quantify such technical and
    practice skills in exact detail. However, the Development Team has taken the view
    that the best way to prepare candidates to meet the changing technical and practical
    requirements of the modern Electrical industry is to ensure candidates have a solid
    foundation of theory and practice upon which they can build new knowledge,
    understanding and skills. Thus, the mandatory section of the HNC Electrical
    Engineering contains fundamental studies in Electrical Principles, Electrical
    Machines, Power Systems, Electrical Safety and Application of Instruments. The
    HND Electrical mandatory section builds on and extends these studies. The studies
    in Electrical Engineering are underpinned by the inclusion of a core Mathematics
    Unit in the HNC and two core Mathematics Units in the HND. The HN Electrical
    Development Team believes that a good grasp of mathematics is essential to the
    understanding of Electrical Engineering.
    The optional sections of both the HNC and HND Electrical Engineering provide
    candidates with the opportunity to specialise in technical and/or non-technical
    subjects. In line with normal good practice centres are encouraged to advise
    candidates to choose those options that best meet their future career and educational
    aspirations.
    The HN Electrical Development Team has also ensured that the two new awards
    contain opportunities for candidates to develop a range of related skills which would
    make the holder of the awards better prepared for employment and/or Degree
    studies. For example, the Communication: Practical Skills Unit has been included
    within the mandatory sections of both HNC and HND awards to provide candidates
    with the opportunity to develop their written and group discussion skills about
    complex vocational issues.
    Whilst a discrete Information Technology Unit is no longer included within the
    HNC mandatory section centres will still have the opportunity to access such a Unit
    via the optional section of the HNC (Information Technology: Applications
    Software 1). Even where centres choose not to select this Unit from the optional
    section there are a number of opportunities to develop Information Technology
    knowledge and skills within individual Units. The Information Technology:
    Applications Software 1 Unit has been included within the core of the HND to allow
    centres to concentrate on business applications, such as word processing,
    spreadsheets, databases, or engineering specific applications or a combination of the
    two.
    A new type of Business Studies Unit, entitled Business Awareness and Continuing
    Professional Development, has been included within the mandatory section of the
    HND Electrical Engineering. This Unit focuses on two areas which the HN
    Electrical Development Team considered important to working in the modern
    electrical industry: namely the external and internal factors that affect business
    performance and the need for continuing learning and development if candidates are
    to have sustainable and rewarding employment in the future.
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 34
    6.2 Delivery
    The new HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards can be delivered on a full-
    time, block-release, part-time day or part-time evening basis.
    In timetabling the two new awards, centre staff should take account of information
    contained in the recommended prior knowledge and skills statement in Unit
    specifications in sequencing the delivery of Units. For example, the Single Phase
    A.C. Circuits Unit would normally be delivered before the Electrical Networks and
    Resonance. Examples of a full-time HNC Electrical Engineering and 2nd Year
    HND Electrical Engineering timetables are shown in Appendix 1.
    One of the key reasons the HN Electrical Development Team has sought to reduce
    the time candidates have to spend on summative Unit assessment is to provide
    lecturers with more time to deliver Units. Lecturers are encouraged, in particular, to
    use this additional time to reinforce learning in core electrical principles and
    technologies and enhance the development of candidates’ practical electrical skills.
    Lecturers may use a variety of teaching and learning approaches in delivering the
    Units in the HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards. These may include
    lecturing, group work, laboratory and practical work, computer simulation (using
    appropriate software packages), project work and case studies. The use of open and
    distance learning and on-line materials may help to supplement and support the
    learning that takes place in the classroom, laboratory or workshop.
    Industrial visits are encouraged wherever possible to provide ‘real life’ industrial
    examples of the application of the theory and practice learnt in the classroom,
    laboratory or workshop.
    The HN Electrical Development Team recognises the very important role computer
    simulation, such as electrical installation software, plays in the modern electrical
    industry. The Team would actively encourage the use of computer simulation
    wherever appropriate but not at the expense of candidates doing practical work. The
    Team believe it is very important that candidates get as much exposure as possible
    to practical electrical hand skills, the use of electrical and electronic test equipment
    and other practical electrical activities if they are to be suitably prepared to work in
    industry.
    Lecturers should also seek opportunities to integrate Core Skills within their
    teaching and learning programmes. Such opportunities may include the following:
    Communication
    ¨ Providing candidates opportunities to develop their oral skills by allowing them
    to give full answers to questions asked by the lecturer and by giving an oral
    presentation in the HND Electrical Engineering Graded Unit project
    ¨ Develop complex, vocationally specific reading skills (eg Electrical Safety,
    Industrial Plant Maintenance etc)
    ¨ Develop report writing skills in a number of Units (eg Electrical Power
    Systems, Three Phase Induction Motors etc)
    ¨ Allowing candidates to develop their Communication skills in group work
    activities (eg Communication: Practical Skills, Electrical Safety)
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 35
    Numeracy
    ¨ Reinforcing Numeracy and Mathematical skills when teaching electrical
    engineering topics (eg Electrical Machine Principles, Electrical Networks and
    Resonance, Synchronous Machines etc)
    ¨ Reinforcing Using Graphical information skills by use of a range of graphical
    representations (eg Power Electronics, Fundamentals of Control Systems and
    Transducers etc)
    Information Technology
    ¨ Develop Information Technology skills through the application of IT within an
    Electrical Engineering context (eg Control Systems Behaviour, Electrical
    Installation Design: Computer Aided etc)
    Problem Solving Skills
    ¨ Develop Critical Thinking Skills through the application of electrical
    engineering principles and technologies to solve electrical engineering
    problems
    ¨ Develop Planning and Organisational skills (eg Utilisation of Electrical Energy
    in Buildings, Industrial Plant Maintenance etc)
    ¨ Develop reviewing and evaluation skills through, for example, the review and
    evaluation of the Outcomes of assignments and project work (eg Applications
    of Power Electronics in Electrical Motor Drive Systems, Electrical Standby
    Systems etc)
    Working with Others
    ¨ Develop Working with Others skills through group discussion on the solution
    to electrical engineering problems (eg Electrical Safety — role play scenario:
    eg issuing a Permit to Work, identifying risk factors) and laboratory and project
    work (eg Analogue Electronics: An Introduction, Digital Electronics etc)
    6.3 Assessment
    From the outset of developments the HN Electrical Development Team recognised
    the need to have an appropriate assessment strategy in place for the HNC and HND
    Electrical Engineering awards. Such a strategy was developed and is shown below:
    Aims
    To ensure that:
    (1) consistent, rigorous and efficient approaches are adopted to the development
    and administration of HN Electrical Engineering assessment instruments at
    both Unit and Graded Unit levels, which satisfy nationally agreed standards.
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 36
    (2) the assessment load on candidates and staff is sensible and that assessment
    does not unduly detract from teaching and learning.
    (3) as far as possible reliable and rigorous moderation processes are put in place
    in order to ensure that consistent national standards are achieved for all HN
    Electrical Engineering assessments.
    Objectives
    Listed below are the measures that have been put in place to meet the aims:
    (1) Develop nationally at least one assessment exemplar pack for each mandatory
    Unit, which clearly sets out the standards of assessment expected in the Unit.
    (2) Adopt a holistic approach to Unit assessment. The implications of this are as
    follows:
    (i) Assessment instruments will normally be designed only to sample
    knowledge and skills in a Unit (this is consistent with the new HN Unit
    format)
    (ii) A Unit assessment strategy will be adopted, where possible, to produce a
    single assessment instrument for the whole Unit. Where this is not
    possible the assessment strategy will seek to ensure that the minimum
    number of assessment instruments required are consistent with
    maintaining agreed national standards.
    (3) Whilst not seeking to be entirely prescriptive with regard to the time spent on
    assessment in each HN Unit, over assessment should be avoided. Assessment
    times are clearly stated in the individual Unit Specifications.
    (4) Produce assessment exemplar packs for the two Graded Units. For the Graded
    Unit examination produce at least one sample exam paper to show the
    standards expected in such a paper. Likewise, for the 2 credit Graded Unit
    Electrical Engineering Project produce a set of materials which clearly set out
    the standards of candidate response required to achieve a Grade A and a
    Grade C.
    (5) Actively encourage centres to work in partnership in producing Graded Unit
    assessment materials, which meet nationally agreed standards reducing, in
    turn, the workload on staff in individual colleges.
    (6) Ensure that consistent and rigorous internal and external moderation
    procedures operate through both HN Unit level and Integrative Assessment
    processes. This places a clear responsibility on both centres and the SQA.
    As far as has been practical the above objectives have been adhered to when
    developing assessment exemplar and Graded Unit materials.
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 37
    Assessment Loading Grid
    An Assessment Loading Grid showing the type and duration of assessment in each
    Unit is shown in Appendix 2. It is hoped that course planners will find this grid
    helpful in timetabling the two awards.
    Assessment Exemplar Materials
    Assessment exemplar packs are in the process of being produced for all mandatory
    Units, and the Graded Units in the HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards.
    Graded Unit Assessment Exemplars
    It is recommended that candidates do not sit the Graded Unit Examination until the
    end of the HNC (1st Year of the HND) given the range of Units that it draws from.
    It is recommended that, given the size and complexity of the project, that the Graded
    Unit Project is started at the beginning of the second year of the HND.
    Formative Assessment
    Formative assessment should be used throughout the delivery of Units to reinforce
    learning, build candidates’ confidence and prepare candidates for summative
    assessment.
    6.4 Re-assessment
    The way in which centres reassess candidates is integral to the way they manage the
    award assessment process as a whole. Re-assessment should be subject to rigorous
    internal moderation in exactly the same way as assessment is.
    Candidates may require to be reassessed on only a part of an assessment where their
    evidence has been generated over a period of time and/or a discrete part of the Unit,
    such as an Outcome, has been assessed originally. On other occasions in may not be
    possible to reassess candidates on parts of their performance which are
    unsatisfactory. Situations where candidates may have to re-do a whole assessment
    include:
    ¨ assessments which test knowledge and understanding and where it may not be
    possible to extract some of the items for reassessment purposes
    ¨ where parts of several Outcomes are involved
    ¨ where a project has been designed as an integral assessment and where there is
    requirement to complete the project as a single complex task
    Re-assessment Opportunities
    Reassessment should operate in accordance with a centre’s assessment policy and
    the professional judgement of the assessor. SQA advises that there should normally
    be one, or in exceptional circumstances two, reassessment opportunities. Please
    refer to SQA’s Guide to Assessment and Quality Assurance for Colleges of Further
    Education, August 2003 revisions.
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 38
    Developing Alternative Assessments
    The design of original assessments should inform the reassessment process to a
    large extent, as the original determines the type of assessment instruments used and
    the purpose of the assessment. It is normal practice for centres to build up a bank of
    assessments which can be used in whole or in part for reassessment purposes.
    Assessment writers should always refer to the Unit specification when developing
    an alternative assessment to ensure that it is of equal demand to the original
    assessment and that it covers all the necessary criteria. Where candidates have not
    provided satisfactory evidence for knowledge and/or skills items which have been
    sampled, they should be reassessed on a different sample.
    Re-assessing HN Graded Units
    Reassessment of the Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 1 should be based on an
    alternative examination paper. Re-assessment of Electrical Engineering: Graded
    Unit 2 should normally entail a candidate undertaking a completely new project.
    Where a candidate marginally fails the Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 2 the
    centre may wish to reassess her/him on that part(s) of the performance which was
    unsatisfactory. Such reassessment would be at the discretion of the centre and
    should be subject to rigorous internal moderation.
    7 Guidance for centres
    7.1 Disabled candidates and/or those with additional support needs
    The additional support needs of individual candidates should be taken into account
    when planning learning experiences, selecting assessment instruments, or
    considering whether any reasonable adjustments may be required. Further advice
    can be found on our website www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.
    7.2 Internal and external verification
    All instruments of assessment used within this/these Group Award(s) should be
    internally verified, using the appropriate policy within the centre and the guidelines
    set by SQA.
    External verification will be carried out by SQA to ensure that internal assessment is
    within the national guidelines for these qualifications.
    Further information on internal and external verification can be found in SQA’s
    Guide to Assessment (www.sqa.org.uk)
    7.3 Assessment moderation
    All assessment instruments used within the HNC and HND Electrical Engineering
    awards should be internally moderated, including assessment exemplar materials,
    using appropriate policies within the centre and guidelines provided by SQA. This
    will ensure the validity and reliability of the instruments of assessment used within
    the centre.
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 39
    External moderation will be carried out by SQA to ensure that internal assessment is
    within the national guidelines for these qualifications.
    For further information on internal and external moderation refer to the SQA Guide
    to Assessment and Quality Assurance for Colleges of Further Education, August
    2003 revision.
    7.4 Open and Distance Learning
    Advice on the use of open and distance learning is given in individual Unit
    specifications. However, where it is used with regard to assessment, planning would
    be required by the centre concerned to ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of
    candidate evidence. Arrangement would be required to be put in place to ensure that
    the assessment or assessments were conducted under the conditions specified in the
    Unit specification. For example, in the case of a Unit which involved a Unit end test
    a centre would have to make arrangements for the test to be conducted under
    controlled, supervised conditions. Likewise, where a Unit involves a practical based
    assessment, a centre would have to make arrangements for candidates to come into
    the centre to undertake the assessment under the conditions specified in the Unit
    specification.
    It should be noted that the same requirements as specified in the previous paragraph
    apply where part or all of a Unit is delivered on-line.
    7.5 Special needs
    The two awards have been designed to ensure that there are no artificial barriers to
    learning or assessment. Centres will need to take account of the special needs of
    individual candidates when planning learning experiences, selecting assessment
    instruments or considering special alternative Outcomes for Units. SQA is currently
    reviewing a guidance document on special assessment arrangements.
    7.6 Credit transfer Arrangements
    A document entitled Credit Transfer Grids has been developed which contains
    information on credit transfer arrangements between old HN Electrical Units (those
    developed as part of the 1996 HN Engineering developments) and the new HN
    Electrical Units (the Units written as part of this development). A copy of this
    document can be found in Appendix 3. This document has been designed to make it
    as straightforward as possible for course admission tutors to work out the level of
    credit transfer a candidate with ‘old’ HN Units or an ‘old’ HNC Engineering:
    Electrical award can count towards the new HNC and HND Electrical Engineering
    awards. As a number of Units in the HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards
    are common to the HNC and HND Electronics awards course admission tutors may
    also have to use the Credit Transfer Document developed for the HNC and HND
    Electronics awards to determine a candidates full credit transfer score. This
    information is contained within the HNC/D Electronics Arrangements Document
    which can be downloaded from the SQA website. The use of these documents is
    illustrated as follows.
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 40

    *With reference to the new two credit, Electrical Engineering: Graded Unit 2
    (Electrical Project) the HN Electrical Development Team has taken the view that the
    old Engineering Project cannot be counted for credit transfer purposes towards the
    new Graded Unit 2 because it contains no mechanism for grading candidates on the
    A, B or C scale.
    7.7 General information for candidates
    The new HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards have been designed by an
    expert team of educators and industrialists with a view to allowing you to meet the
    educational requirements to work as an electrical incorporated engineer. The two
    new qualifications contain up-to-date and relevant electrical subject content and
    skills and have also been designed to satisfy the new SQA Higher National Design
    Principles.
    The HN Electrical Development Team has designed the two new awards so that you
    will have opportunities to learn and understand the core principles and technologies
    that underpin Electrical Engineering. Learning these will be essential in providing
    you with a platform for tackling many electrical tasks and in allowing you to
    develop a more in-depth knowledge of Electrical Engineering. At the same time
    studying the new HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards will provide you
    with opportunities to develop sound practical electrical investigation, construction,
    testing and project skills which are critical to being a good electrical technician
    and/or incorporated engineer.
    As well as studying Electrical subjects you will also take Communication with an
    option to do Information Technology as part of the HNC. Good Communication
    skills are essential to understanding technical material, and when communicating
    with others whether on an individual basis or when working as part of a team.
    Information Technology underpins much of the work in Electrical Engineering
    whether this is through computer simulation of electrical and electronic circuits or
    systems or in preparing a written report on the work you have been involved in.
    Opportunities to develop Information Technology knowledge and skills are
    available in a number of Units in the HNC, but an optional Unit on Information
    Technology Applications is also available if you wish to consolidate your skills in
    this area.
    The Communication and Information Technology Units are mandatory within the
    HND Electrical Engineering award although you will not need to study these Units
    if you have already done so as part of the HNC. There is an additional mandatory
    core Unit in the HND Electrical Engineering award entitled Business Awareness
    and Continuing Professional Development. This Unit will provide you with an
    awareness of the business pressures on modern electrical companies and what
    strategies they are adopting to meet these pressures. The Unit will also provide you
    with the opportunity to develop your own career and education action plan for the
    next five years or so.
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 44
    As already mentioned Electrical Engineering is very much about learning and
    understanding core principles and technologies whilst also doing practical work
    such as constructing and testing circuits and project work. Thus, while taking the
    HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards you can anticipate that the teaching
    and learning approaches adopted by your lecturers will include the following:
    lecturing, group work, practical electrical and electronics work, inspection and
    testing, computer simulation of circuits and installations and project work.
    The Electrical Development Team has ensured that assessments in the two awards
    meet national standards. The two awards have been designed to optimise assessment
    so that sufficient time is available for you to learn the electrical principles and
    technologies and the practical skills that are essential to being a good electrical
    technician and incorporated engineer.
    You can expect to do assessment at individual Unit level and at qualification level.
    At Unit level assessment will consist of some form of written end test, or a
    combination of short written test and practical exercise or a purely practical
    exercise. Your lecturer should tell you at the start of the Unit what form the Unit
    assessment will take. In additional, to Unit tests there will also be a 3-hour
    examination at HNC level and a 2-credit project at HND level. Both these
    assessments have been designed to allow you to demonstrate your ability to
    integrate knowledge, understanding and skills learnt in the two awards as a whole.
    The HN Electrical Development Team does not wish to place any artificial barriers
    in the way of potential candidates wanting to study the two awards. However, it
    would be unfair to enrol a candidate into the HNC and HND who did not have a
    realistic chance of successfully achieving either or both awards. The HN Electrical
    Development Team would therefore recommend that a candidate had one of the
    following qualifications before entering the HNC and HND Electrical Engineering:
    (1) One Higher from Physics, Technological Studies or Higher Mathematics and at
    least three Standard Grades 1-2/ Intermediate 2 passes including Mathematics,
    Physics/Technological Studies and English.
    (2) A National Certificate in Electrical Engineering or Electronic Engineering.
    (3) Equivalent qualifications or experience to those shown in (1) and (2).
    An HNC or HND Electrical Engineering award no longer satisfies the full academic
    requirements to become an incorporated engineer (a Degree is now required).
    However, the new HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards provide a very
    solid platform for candidates to proceed to the advanced stages of a Degree
    programme in Electrical Engineering. Ask your lecturer about progression
    arrangements your college has with any Universities.
    Arrangements Document: HNC Electrical Engineering (G7TA 15) and HND Electrical Engineering (G7TC 16) 45
    7.8 Relationship to other awards
    An HNC and HND Electronics were validated in 2004. Since a number of Units are
    common between HNC and HND Electrical Engineering and Electronics awards
    candidates will have opportunities to transfer a significant number of Units between
    the various awards. More limited opportunities will exist for candidates to transfer
    Units between the HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards and awards in
    Mechanical Engineering, Manufacturing Systems, Mechatronics, General
    Engineering and Fabrication and Welding and vice versa.
    7.9 Articulation Arrangements
    All the universities in Scotland were contacted regarding possible articulation routes
    between the HNC and HND Electrical Engineering awards and Degree courses
    offered by the universities. In general terms, universities indicated that they will
    allow candidates with an HNC to enter the first year of their electrical engineering
    (or related engineering) Degrees programmes. Candidates with an HND will
    normally be allowed to enter the second year of a Degree programme provided they
    have the Unit, Mathematics for Engineering 3.

    It is recognised that timetabling in a four block system is not done by every centre. The above grid is therefore only a guide indicating the order of delivery of
    Units.

    As with the previous HNC grid, it is recognised that timetabling in a four block system is not done by every centre. The above grid is therefore only a guide
    indicating the order of delivery of Units.
    Centres may wish to spread the delivery of Units over more than one block which would allow more Units to be delivered in parallel.
    Whichever delivery arrangement is used, it is important to complete the delivery of ALL the HND Units over the two years of a full-time programme.

    A candidate in possession of the OLD Unit, Analogue Electronic Devices, should be awarded 33% (Outcome 1) credit transfer to the NEW Unit, Analogue
    Electronics: An Introduction. This relates the Outcomes of the OLD Unit to Outcome 1 of the NEW Unit dealing with the operation and characteristics of
    diodes, bipolar transistors and FETs.
    Outcomes 2 (describe applications) and 3 (demonstrate applications) of the NEW Unit are not covered in the OLD Unit and must therefore be taught and
    assessed.

    Unit specification: support notes
    Unit title: High Level Engineering Software
    This part of the Unit specification is offered as guidance. The support notes are not mandatory.
    While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional design length
    is 40 hours.
    Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
    This Unit has been written in order to allow candidates to develop the knowledge, understanding and
    skills in the area of Software Engineering by writing and testing I/O programs. The following
    processes illustrate Software Engineering:
    ¨ user requirements
    ¨ problem specification
    ¨ system design (partitioning into manageable tasks)
    ¨ detailed design (design of individual modules)
    ¨ implementation (coding into chosen programming language)
    ¨ program verification (software testing)
    ¨ program maintenance (extending the program for the future)
    With validation and documentation taking place at all the stages.
    This Unit was designed to permit the candidates to apply the software engineering techniques to
    formulate the solutions to engineering tasks involving input and output ports. Software may be
    developed for a PC or single board computer or a micro-controller in conjunction with an applications
    board. Candidates may be provided with subprograms to configure and read/write input/output ports.
    This Unit was developed as one of four SQA Advanced Certificate/Diploma in Engineering
    Programming options and is at SCQF level 7. This Unit should be completed before tackling the level
    8 Unit, High Level Language: External I/O Transfer.
    The Unit has identified the topics that are expected to be covered by lecturers. The Unit also gives
    recommendations as to how much time should be spent on each Outcome. This has been done to help
    lecturers to decide what depth of treatment should be given to the topics attached to each of the
    Outcomes. Whilst it is not mandatory for a centre to use this list of topics it is strongly recommended
    that they do so to ensure continuity of teaching and learning across the Engineering Computing Units
    and because the assessment exemplar pack for this Unit is based on the Knowledge and/or Skills and
    list of topics in each of the Outcomes.
    A list of topics is given below. Lecturers are advised to study this list in conjunction with the
    assessment exemplar pack for this Unit so they can get a clear indication of the standard of
    achievement expected of candidates taking the Unit.

    Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
    This is the first engineering programming Unit on the SQA Advanced Certificate/Diploma Electronics
    and for many candidates this may be their first encounter with programming. In this respect it may be
    advisable to deliver this Unit on a free-standing basis.
    Each candidate should have access to a computer loaded with appropriate OS and High Level
    Language software. Additionally workstations should be available on which candidates are able to test
    I/O based programs.
    Delivery of all the Outcomes may be carried out using an LCD projector so that the candidates can
    view the actual code of the sample programs and see their execution with prepared test data in real
    terms.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    Unit HP41 47: High Level Engineering Software 10
    This introductory Unit should be used to develop the candidate’s confidence in the basic
    programming concepts and as such should be taken before considering assembly language
    programming.
    It is suggested that the Unit assessment take the form of a logbook or portfolio covering the four
    Outcomes.
    For example, assuming a two-hour class per week, then over a 20-week period the assessment
    schedule may be:
    Weeks 1 to 5 Linear programming
    Outcome 1 assignments completed (2hours)
    Weeks 6 to 10 Non-linear programming for I/O ports using selection statements
    Outcome 2 assignments completed (2hours)
    Weeks 11 to 15 Non-linear I/O programming using iterative loops
    Outcome 3 assignments completed (2hours)
    Weeks 16 to 20 I/O programming using bit-wise operations
    Outcome 4 assignments completed (4hours)
    Open learning
    This Unit is more suitable for laboratory delivery however it could be delivered by distance learning
    provided the candidate has the appropriate hardware. This may require some degree of on-line
    support. However, with regard to assessment, planning would be required by the centre concerned to
    ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of candidate evidence. Arrangements would be required to be
    put in place to ensure that assessment whether done at a single or at multiple events was conducted
    under controlled, supervised conditions.
    To keep administrative arrangements to a minimum, it is recommended that a single assessment paper
    (taken by candidates at a single assessment event) be used for distance learning candidates.
    Equality and inclusion
    This unit specification has been designed to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to
    learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be taken into account when
    planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or considering alternative
    evidence.
    Further advice can be found on our website www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    Unit HP41 47: High Level Engineering Software 11
    General information for candidates
    Unit title: High Level Engineering Software
    This is the first of four Engineering Programming Units in the SQA Advanced Certificate/Diploma
    Electronics. This Unit introduces you to I/O programming in the context of the Software Engineering
    Process. This process allows you to break down the overall programming task into manageable sub
    tasks.
    These smaller modules are then developed, debugged and tested using a High Level Language. The
    overall program is then constructed by integrating the modules one by one and testing as the program
    builds up. The final program is tested for functionality and each branch is exercised using appropriate
    test data.
    This Unit teaches you:
    ¨ system design (partitioning of a software task)
    ¨ detailed design (stepwise refinement using pseudo code or flowcharts)
    ¨ coding in a High Level Language
    ¨ compiling and debugging
    ¨ preparing test data and verifying program function
    ¨ documentation
    In addition you will learn and practise the following programming constructs:
    ¨ linear programming
    ¨ IF…THEN, IF…THEN…ELSE, CASE…
    ¨ FOR…NEXT…DO
    ¨ REPEAT…UNTIL
    ¨ WHILE…DO
    ¨ procedure/functions
    ¨ logical bit-wise operations
    You will be presented with a variety of programs, but the emphasis will be on driving or controlling
    hardware interface circuitry. Hence you will also cover INPUT/OUTPUT ports, configuring them,
    writing to them and reading from them.
    The time allocated for this Unit is 40 hours. If you are new to programming then you will probably
    require to spend double this amount as the practical activities can be time consuming. It is in your
    interest not just to pass the Unit for qualification needs but to master it, as most electronics related
    jobs and higher study demand the skills and knowledge embedded in this Unit.
    Your assessment for this Unit will be assignments covering each of the four Outcomes, to be carried
    out in the context of the Software Engineering Process. Class time allocated for this will be about 14
    hours, however you will be expected to devote the same number of hours in private study for the
    assignments. The written assignments must conform to the standard set out by the lecturer. Outcome 4

    must be submitted within 14 days of completion of the Unit.

    While the exact time allocated to this unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional
    design length is 40 hours.
    Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
    This unit provides a solid basis on which further IT skills can be built. It will enable learners to
    use IT systems with minimal support, paying due regard to security. Electronic data sources
    are to be used, learners are expected to achieve effective results when using IT software in
    an unfamiliar context by using on-line help facilities and suppliers’ handbooks. Basic
    configuration and fault-finding skills are to be taught. Files should be provided for learners as
    appropriate to negate the need for them to enter large amounts of text or data.
    This unit is very much aimed at enabling learners to obtain and use data and software
    applications packages associated with the internet and email, ie electronic communications.
    Therefore, there should be considerable emphasis placed upon providing access to
    appropriate data and software associated with electronic communications. Candidates
    should then be encouraged to learn for themselves the benefits of being able to integrate
    information from diverse sources and produce documents, designs, compositions, models or
    presentations of a complex nature.
    The unit can be approached from the standpoint of using information technology to support a
    range of information processing activities. The learner should be able to plan for, develop
    and produce the relevant information requirements of users.
    Candidates should achieve the level of competence required of a regular user of IT
    applications software in a commercial or professional situation. Candidates will require
    individual access to a personal computer/workstation. It is suggested that, wherever
    possible, commercially available current versions of industry standard software be used. The
    component parts of an integrated software package along with its operating environment can
    be used to achieve all Outcomes. This should not be prohibitive in the case of the centres,
    but may be an issue if being undertaken in the workplace.
    It is generally assumed that the environment for this unit will be, for example, Microsoft
    Windows and Office 97/2000 or Lotus, or other vendor equivalents, however, this is not
    specified and the Outcome requirements are deliberately generic in nature.
    Outcome 1 looks at the components of hardware, the functions of operating system tools and
    how these are used. Data security measures, resolving common hardware and software
    problems are also pre-eminent. All of the elements should be taught in the context of giving
    attention to the needs of other users of a computer system.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HP6L 47, Information Technology: Applications Software 1 (SCQF level 7) 6
    Outcome 2 looks at using a range of software packages to meet complex information
    requirements. Centres can choose four or more packages (a minimum of four different
    packages must be used) from the whole range of applications packages available. The
    software application packages chosen must be relevant to the vocational area of the Group
    Award undertaken by the learner. The emphasis in this Outcome should be on producing
    complex information in a context that is unfamiliar to the learner. Candidates should be able
    to integrate data types, (eg text, number, graphics, audio, video) into a single product and to
    format the product so that the final output is clear and helpful to users. Candidates should
    show that they can plan for the information requirements; select and use software packages
    appropriate to information requirements; select suitable computer data sources for
    information and extract suitable information from these computer data sources to meet
    relevant requirements.
    An indication of the range of activities that learners are expected to be able to carry out when
    using a variety of software applications packages during the course of this unit is given below
    for some of the ‘standard’ applications that centres may use. This should not be taken to be a
    ‘prescriptive’, or indeed, an exhaustive list of requirements but should help to serve as a
    guide to the level of skills required.
    1 Selection and use of appropriate software applications packages and electronic data
    sources from both local and remote computers.
    2 Selection and use of document layout, page layout and format facilities, eg: views, use
    of toolbars, rulers, guides, zoom, fonts, bullets and numbering, borders and shading,
    tabs, case, dropped capitals, columns, themes, backgrounds, styles, frames, colours
    and lines, alignment, templates, auto-format.
    3 Use of on-line help and tutorial support facilities.
    4 File Handling, eg properties, naming conventions, saving, saving for use with web and
    other applications, retrieving, retrieving from web and other applications, copying,
    renaming, importing, exporting, emailing, attachments, routing, and faxing.
    5 Editing, eg undo, repeat, cut, copy, paste, paste special, select all, fill, clear, find,
    replace, go to, rename, links, and objects.
    6 Selection and use of insertions, eg headers and footers, page breaks, comments,
    footnotes, captions, numbering, symbols, date and time, index and tables, bookmarks,
    pictures, objects, hyperlinks, graphics, movies, sounds, tables, queries, forms and
    reports, functions, charts, comments, fields, records and files.
    7 Use of ‘tools’, eg spelling and grammar checker; thesaurus; search and replace; auto-
    correction; sort; merge; customisation; options; security; protection; macros (simple); on-
    line facilities; send and receive; address books, synchronisation, message rules,
    messenger services, newsgroups and accounts.
    8 Printing, eg printer selection; printer properties; printer set up, eg paper size, paper type,
    scaling, orientation, etc; print preview; use of print preview facilities, eg zoom, multiple
    pages, ruler, scaling, etc.
    9 Searching should involve several criteria, eg key terms or fields, and requires decisions
    to be made about an effective strategy for their application, eg with due regard for time,
    cost, effective filtering and result.
    10 Extracting and presenting relevant information - relevant data may be records in a
    database, a photographic image, a video or audio clip. Selection/importation may involve
    tools such as screen grabbers, digital or video cameras and scanners.
    This unit is designed to enable students to use IT systems and applications independently to
    support a range of information processing activities. The unit is designed to develop a
    knowledge of the theoretical concepts, principles, boundaries and scope of IT applications.
    These activities will be centred on using several software application packages to meet
    complex information requirements.

    HP6L 47, Information Technology: Applications Software 1 (SCQF level 7) 7
    Instrument of assessment
    There are two Outcomes, both largely of a practical nature.
    Outcome 1: Prove Knowledge and/or Skills of: the different components of a computer
    system, the function of tools such as file manager, print manager and control panel, the ways
    in which data can be kept secure and the causes of common software and hardware
    problems and how to resolve them.
    Outcome 2: Uses a range of software application packages, (at least four) to meet complex
    information requirements. The learners will be given a comprehensive checklist of all
    evidence required to successfully complete this Outcome. They will then have to create a
    technical manual and player guide indicating on the checklist exactly where each
    requirement has been met. Given the complexity of the technical manuals and user guides
    shipped with today’s games, this should make for a demanding, but hopefully enjoyable
    experience.
    Guidance on approaches to delivery of this Unit
    This unit is designed to enable learners to use IT systems independently to support a range
    of information processing activities. Early inclusion of this unit in the Group Award is
    preferable as students should then be able to present work for other Units using the skills
    learned in this unit.
    During the course of the unit learners should have several opportunities to develop their
    practical skills and should then be assessed appropriately.
    Assessment should be by one project or case study. Candidates should have access to on-
    line help, tutorial support and/or suppliers’ manuals as required.
    Individual centres will need to plan Outcome 2 to ensure that such resources as the internet
    service provider, compact discs, available telephone lines, modems, software application
    packages and operating systems updates are available prior to commencement of the unit.
    If this unit is being delivered as part of a Professional Development Award which receives
    endorsement from a vendor such as Microsoft, it must be delivered and evidence generated
    as detailed in the document ‘Approval to certification’ which is associated with that particular
    vendor and the Professional Development Award.
    Guidance on approaches to assessment of this Unit
    Evidence can be generated using different types of assessment. The following are
    suggestions only. There may be other methods that would be more suitable to learners.
    Centres are reminded that prior verification of centre-devised assessments would help to
    ensure that the national standard is being met. Where learners experience a range of
    assessment methods, this helps them to develop different skills that should be transferable to
    work or further and higher education.
    Outcome 2
    The emphasis in this Outcome should be on producing complex information in a context
    which is unfamiliar to the learner. Centres may wish to complete an observation checklist to
    keep track of the learner’s development in the use of the four chosen software applications
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    HP6L 47, Information Technology: Applications Software 1 (SCQF level 7) 8
    packages. The software application packages chosen must be relevant to the vocational
    area of the Group Award undertaken by the learner.
    Opportunities for e-assessment
    E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this unit. By e-assessment we
    mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
    such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to use
    e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence and
    that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met,
    regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
    e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at
    www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
    Opportunities for developing Core and other essential skills
    This unit gives automatic certification of the core skill: Using Information Technology at
    SCQF level 6.

    General information for learners
    Unit title: Information Technology: Applications Software 1
    (SCQF level 7)
    This section will help you decide whether this is the unit for you by explaining what the unit is
    about, what you should know or be able to do before you start, what you will need to do
    during the unit and opportunities for further learning and employment.
    This unit is designed to enable you to use IT systems and applications independently to
    support a range of information processing activities. You should develop a broad knowledge
    of the theoretical concepts, principles, boundaries and scope of IT applications. By the end of
    the unit you should have learned how to plan for, develop and produce the relevant
    information requirements of users.
    To meet the requirements of users you will be required to use and develop a broad range of
    skills in a range of software applications packages, (a minimum of four), such as, word
    processor, spreadsheet, database, simulation, graphics, communications, (ie internet,
    intranet, email, etc), audio/music, animation, video, multimedia, desktop publishing, data
    logging and retrieval, control or other packages.
    On successful completion of the unit you will be able to:
    1 Operate a range of IT equipment independently, giving attention to security and to other
    users.
    2 Use a range of software packages to meet complex information requirements.
    In Outcome 1 you will learn about the components of hardware, the functions of operating
    system tools and how these are used. You will also learn about data security measures and
    resolving common hardware and software problems. You will learn about all of the elements
    above in the context of meeting the needs of all users of a computer system.
    In Outcome 2 you will learn about how to use a range of software packages to meet complex
    information requirements. You will learn about a minimum of four different software packages
    from the whole range of applications packages available. The emphasis in this Outcome will
    be on producing complex information in a context that is unfamiliar to you. You will learn how
    to integrate data types, (eg text, number, graphics, audio, video) into a single product and to
    format the product so that the final output is clear and helpful to users. You will find out how
    to: plan to meet users’ information requirements; select software packages appropriate to
    information requirements; select suitable computer data sources for information and extract
    suitable information from these computer data sources to meet relevant user requirements.
    To complete this unit successfully, you must demonstrate a satisfactory level of performance
    in a number of tasks covering the Outcomes listed above. You must provide evidence of the
    work you carry out for each assessment task in the form of a set of printed documents with a
    front cover: each print having details of your name, the date and the task. You will be
    encouraged to access on-line help facilities, tutorial support and/or suppliers’ manuals as
    required.
    More detailed guidance on the content, amount, style and quality required of your work will
    be made available to you during your progress through the unit. Your assessor will observe
    you carrying out the assessment tasks, and will complete an observation checklist to certify
    that each of your prints is your own work and whether or not it has reached the required
    standard.Unit (HV2L 47): Inspection and Testing of Low Voltage Electrical Installations 1

    This part of the Unit specification is offered as guidance. The support notes are not mandatory.
    While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional design length
    is 40 hours.
    Guidance on the content and context for this Unit
    This Unit has been written in order to allow candidates to develop their knowledge and competence
    in the following areas:
    1. General requirements for the inspection and testing of an electrical installation
    during its normal life-cycle.
    2. Recommended tests to verify the integrity of an electrical installation.
    3. Requirements and precautions for testing electrical installations
    4. Testing procedures which conform to British Standard requirements
    In designing this Unit, the unit writer has identified the range of topics expected to be covered by
    lecturers. The writer has also given recommendations as to how much time should be spent on each
    Outcome. This has been done to help lecturers decide what depth of treatment should be given to the
    topics attached to each of the Outcomes. Whilst it is not mandatory for centres to use this list of
    topics, it is recommended that they do so since the assessment exemplar pack for this Unit is based on
    the knowledge and/or skills and list of topics in each of the Outcomes.
    A list of topics for each Outcome is given below. Lecturers are advised to study this list in
    conjunction with the assessment exemplar pack so that they can get a clear indication of the standard
    of achievement expected of candidates in this Unit
    1 Explain the general requirements for the inspection and testing of an electrical
    installation during its normal life-cycle. (10 hrs)
    This Outcome should provide candidate with an understanding of the general requirements for
    inspection and testing of an electrical installation when it is newly installed, the periodicity of re-
    inspecting and testing and the action that should be taken if alterations or additions are made. The
    requirements of part seven of BS7671 provided the technical foundation for developing the subject
    and the IEE guidance notes on Inspection and Testing (ISBN 0-85296-991-0) develop the regulations.
    ¨ Safety
    ¨ Required competence
    ¨ The Client
    ¨ Record keeping
    ¨ Purpose of initial verification
    ¨ Frequency of subsequent installations
    ¨ Initial inspection
    Consideration should also be given to the following:
    Electrical installation: TN-S; TN-C-S; TT. Nominal voltage 230V and 400V; rating of over current
    protective devices at the origin of the installation not to exceed 100A; work environment is domestic;
    commercial and light industrial.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    Unit (HV2L 47): Inspection and Testing of Low Voltage Electrical Installations 9
    Initial Inspection: connection and identification of conductors; cable routing; current carrying
    capacity; voltage drop; connection of control devices; connection of accessories; equipment; fire
    barriers; methods of protection against electric shock; labelling, presence of notices; erection
    methods; presence of under-voltage protection; adequate access to switchgear and equipment;
    protection methods for direct and indirect contact; adequate earthing arrangements; selection of
    equipment and protective measures appropriate to external influences; position of devices for
    isolation and switching location.
    Reasons for periodic testing and inspection; legislative requirements; verification of continued
    compliance with BS7671; change of ownership or tenancy of premises; alterations or additions to
    existing installation to change electrical loading.
    2 Explain the recommended tests to verify the integrity of an electrical installation (10 hrs)
    This Outcome should provide the candidate with an understanding of why the tests are being carried
    out; the requirements that have to be met to satisfy part seven of BS7671 and the methods of tests that
    are to be performed.
    The Outcome should provide candidates with an understanding of why it is necessary to know the
    value of the prospective short circuit current and the external earth loop impedance and also provide
    an explanation of how to approach the measurement of these.
    ¨ Purpose of periodic inspection and testing
    ¨ Necessity for periodic inspection and testing
    ¨ Initial testing
    Electrical installation: TN-S; TN-C-S; T.T. Systems
    Tests: Continuity of protective conductors main and supplementary bonding, continuity of ring final
    circuit conductors; insulation resistance; polarity tests; earth electrode resistance; earth fault loop
    impedance; operation of residual current devices; measurement of characteristics of supply at the
    origin of the circuit.
    3 Explain the requirements and precautions for testing electrical installations (10 hrs)
    This Outcome should provide the candidate with an understanding of why safety documentation is
    essential before work is carried out in organisations that specify permits-to-work and sanction-to-test
    documents as part of their safety policy. The responsibility of the electrical contractor to comply
    with safety procedures and the delegation of authorised signatories by the company to the contractor,
    for safety documents, should be discussed. The need to recognise that intrinsically safe instruments
    are required in installations designated as hazardous should be emphasised. Reference only is
    required to the zoning of areas and the types of environment where more specialist testing
    consideration is necessary.
    Relevant requirements of the Health and Safety at Work Act and the Electricity at Work Regulations
    in an industrial environment, where additional hazards may be present, permits-to-work and
    sanctions-for-test.
    SQA Advanced Unit Specification
    Unit (HV2L 47): Inspection and Testing of Low Voltage Electrical Installations 10
    Requirements: instrument accuracy; field and instrument errors; routine calibration and checking of
    low resistance ohmmeter; insulation resistance ohmmeter; applied voltage tester; earth fault loop
    impedance testers; earth electrode, test sets; RCD Testers.
    4 Carry out appropriate testing procedures which conform to British Standard
    requirements (10 hrs)
    This Outcome should provide the candidate with the opportunity to prepare for inspection and testing
    and carry out inspection and testing.
    The centre will require a simulated test rig(s) to enable the tests specified in the range statement to be
    carried out effectively. It is recommended that the rig(s) should be supplied from a three-phase
    isolator and feed a single-phase distribution board from which lighting circuits and power circuits are
    supplied. A three phase motor circuit should be provided for. A residual current device or devices
    should be included in the design. The design of the rig or rigs is not critical providing all the tests
    can be performed effectively. Different rigs can be used to cover the complete range of tests.
    Observation checklists are required for each of the tests. The candidate should be given the
    necessary work instructions to carry out the testing. A selection of the necessary hand tools and a
    range of test instruments should be provided. During the test the candidate will be expected to record
    all relevant information and tests results for all circuits on an appropriate results sheets; safe working
    practice must be observed throughout the inspection and testing procedure.
    Technical data: available diagrams; charts; previous test results for inspection; test
    certificates; general characteristics of installation; access to design data (new installation).
    Isolation procedure: isolate; lock off; issue permit-to-work; complete permit documentation; test for
    dead.
    Test of external earth loop impedance and prospective short circuit current (PSCC); protective
    conductors continuity: continuity of ring final circuit conductors; insulation resistance; polarity;
    Earth fault loop impedance; earth electrode resistance; operation of residual current devices
    A candidate-centred learning approach is recommended. Underpinning theory should be reinforced
    by use of short testing exercises where a hands-on-approach should be encouraged. Throughout the
    Unit the importance of accurate documentation should be stressed. Safety procedures and practices
    should be observed at every stage of the unit.
    Guidance on the delivery and assessment of this Unit
    The purpose of this Unit is to enable candidates to demonstrate knowledge, understanding and
    competence in the testing and inspection of electrical installations.
    The Unit is aimed at those with previous electrical installation knowledge and some knowledge of

    HV2W 47, Electrical Design Systems: An Introduction (SCQF level 7) 4
    Evidence Requirements for Outcomes 1 and 2
    Evidence for the Knowledge and/or Skills items in Outcomes 1 and 2 should be provided on
    a sample basis. The evidence may be presented in response to specific questions. Each
    candidate will need to demonstrate that they can answer questions correctly based on a
    sample under the knowledge and skills items shown in both Outcomes.
    The assessment should incorporate two Knowledge and/or Skills items from each Outcome.
    In any assessment of the Outcomes, Knowledge and/or Skills item four from both Outcomes
    must always be selected along with any one of the other three knowledge/skills statements
    in each Outcome.
    In order to ensure that candidates will not be able to foresee what items they will be
    questioned on, a different Knowledge and/or Skills item from each Outcome, as well
    Knowledge and/or Skills item four in both Outcomes, should be sampled each time the
    Outcomes are assessed. Candidates must provide a satisfactory response to all items.
    Where sampling takes place, a candidates response can be judged to be satisfactory where
    evidence provided is sufficient to meet the requirements for each item by showing that the
    candidate is able to:
    Outcome 1
    ¨ Explain that the purpose of earthing transformer windings is to minimise disturbances to
    the power system from overvoltages that can damage conductor and motor insulation
    connected to the system.
    ¨ Describe the types of earth electrodes for power systems and methods of reducing
    surface voltage gradients and risks from step voltages.
    ¨ Describe how equipment earthing can achieve protection against electric shock.
    ¨ Evaluate Touch Voltage Curves and determine if protection against electric shock can
    be achieved from calculations of earth fault loop impedance values and disconnection
    times of protective devices.
    Outcome 2
    ¨ Determine the design current for TP&N electrical installations and the reasons for
    balancing the current across three phases.
    ¨ Explain the operation and function of protective devices for electric motors and fuses for
    semi conductor applications.
    ¨ Describe how PVC, XLPE (low smoke zero halogen) and magnesium oxide conductor
    insulations are selected to overcome external influences.
    ¨ Calculate the design current and select conductor sizes for three-phase and single-
    phase loads and confirm that the circuits comply with the voltage drop constraint.
    The assessment for Outcomes 1 and 2 must be combined together to form one assessment
    paper. This assessment should be taken at a single assessment event lasting one and a half
    hours and carried out under supervised, controlled conditions. Assessment should be
    conducted under closed-book conditions and as such candidates should not be allowed to
    bring any additional material to the assessment. Candidates should be permitted to use
    scientific calculators during the assessment. Centres must provide candidates with all the
    relevant reference design material to satisfactorily complete the assessment.
    HV2W 47, Electrical Design Systems: An Introduction (SCQF level 7) 5
    Assessment Guidelines for Outcomes 1 and 2
    The assessment paper should be composed of an appropriate balance of short answer and
    structured questions that may incorporate sketches/diagrams to demonstrate enhanced
    understanding. Centres should devise only the charts, reference tables and diagrams or
    drawings necessary for candidates to satisfactorily complete the assessment.
    Outcome 3
    Investigate structured distribution data cable systems for communication networks.
    Knowledge and/or Skills
    ¨ Local Area Networks (LAN)
    ¨ Structured cabling for data and communication networks
    ¨ Extended star topology installation systems
    ¨ Configuration of patch panel arrangements
    ¨ Attenuation to crosstalk ratio (ACR)
    Evidence Requirements for Outcome 3
    All Knowledge and/or Skills items in Outcome 3 should be assessed. The evidence should
    be presented in response to an assignment in which candidates are set the task of
    investigating the requirements and outlining the basic design of a communication network for
    a small modern operation.
    The candidate assignment can be judged to be satisfactory where the evidence provided is
    valid, relevant and sufficient to meet the requirements for each item by showing that he/she
    can:
    ¨ identify the economic function of a LAN and describe the type of information that can be
    transmitted.
    ¨ describe the different types and specific design applications of structured data cables.
    ¨ describe the operation of the network.
    ¨ describe the process for Patch Panel wiring for data applications.
    ¨ explain ways of ensuring the Attenuation to Crosstalk ratio (ACR) complies with the
    required parameters of BS EN standards.
    Candidates should produce a report of between 1,000–1,200 words or equivalent that
    includes diagrams and appendices on the specification for the network system. Candidates
    should have access to course notes, relevant textbooks, instruction manuals, supplier’s and

    Important Note
    Where the term Advanced Certificate/HNC Engineering Practice is used throughout this
    document it should generally be understood to mean Advanced Certificate in Fabrication and
    Welding/Advanced Certificate in Engineering Manufacture/Advanced Certificate in
    Engineering Maintenance/Advanced Certificate in Electrical Engineering/HNC Engineering
    Practice.
    Where the term PDA/HNC Engineering Practice is used throughout this document it should
    generally be understood to mean PDA in Engineering Practice: Fabrication and Welding at
    SCQF level 7/PDA in Engineering Practice: Engineering Manufacture at SCQF level 7/PDA
    in Engineering Practice: Engineering Maintenance at SCQF level 7/PDA in Engineering
    Practice: Electrical Engineering at SCQF level 7/HNC Engineering Practice.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 1
    1 Introduction
    This is the Arrangements Document for the following awards:
    PDA* in Engineering Practice: Fabrication and Welding at SCQF level 7;
    PDA in Engineering Practice: Engineering Manufacture at SCQF level 7;
    PDA in Engineering Practice: Engineering Maintenance at SCQF level 7;
    PDA in Engineering Practice: Electrical Engineering at SCQF level 7;
    HNC Engineering Practice.
    *PDA stands for Professional Development Award.
    The four PDAs were validated in February 2010 while the HNC Engineering
    Practice was validated in February 2006
    This document includes: background information on the development of the Group
    Award, its aims, guidance on access, details of the Group Award structure and
    guidance on delivery and assessment.
    The four Advanced Certificates in Fabrication and Welding, Engineering
    Manufacture, Engineering Maintenance and Electrical Engineering together with an
    HNC Engineering Practice were successfully validated in February 2006. Since that
    date SQA has revised its Design Principles for Professional Development Awards
    which span the range SCQF levels 6 to 12. As SQA is phasing out the Advanced
    Certificate qualification and as the Advanced Certificates mentioned earlier in this
    paragraph fit neatly into the PDA Design Principles it was considered appropriate to
    convert the Advanced Certificates into PDAs. In undertaking this task no change has
    been made to the structure and content of the original four Advanced Certificates or
    the HNC Engineering Practice. The only significant change in this document from
    the original Advanced Certificate/HNC Engineering Practice Arrangements
    Document is a change in name from Advanced Certificate to Professional
    Development Award together with recognition of the level of the four PDAs as
    SCQF level 7. Thus, much of this current Arrangements Document remains the
    same as that produced for the previous Advanced Certificates/HNC Engineering
    Practice Arrangements Document in 2006. However, justification is included in this
    updated Arrangements Document on the ways in which converting the four
    Advanced Certificates into PDAs meets the Design Principles for PDAs at SCQF
    levels 7–12. Furthermore, since 2006 SQA has also introduced a range of new
    National Certificates in Engineering and reference to these in terms of the way they
    provide access to the four PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards is made in the
    Access to the Awards section of this document.
    2 Rationale for the revision of the awards
    2.1 Group Award Titles
    The PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards will form part of the SQA suite of HN
    Engineering awards which were redeveloped as part of the implementation of the
    new SQA HN Design Principles. The PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards are
    designed for those candidates who are employed, or who wish to gain employment,
    as advanced engineering craft persons and supervisors within an engineering
    environment. They, thus, occupy a unique position in the current suite of HN
    Engineering qualifications in that all other Engineering awards are geared more to
    the education and training of engineering technicians and incorporated engineers.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 2
    In undertaking the review of the Advanced Certificates/HNC Engineering Practice
    awards (now re-titled PDA/HNC Engineering Practice) in 2005-06 the QDT
    (Qualification Design Team) considered carefully the structure and titles of the
    previous awards. The QDT essentially retained the structure of the previous awards
    (ie 6-credits for an Advanced Certificate and a further 6-credits for an HNC
    Engineering Practice). However, the QDT made certain modifications to the titles of
    some of the previous awards to clarify the purpose and content of the awards.
    Details of changes to the awards with an explanation for the reasons for the change
    are shown in the table below.

    Title changed to reflect that
    the new award’s primary
    focus is on Electrical
    Engineering subjects.
    Stakeholders had difficulty
    understanding the
    Electromechanical title
    which may explain this
    award’s low uptake in
    terms of candidate entries.
    The new award title is
    easier to understand and
    generally more recognised
    by stakeholders of craft
    awards.

    2.2 History and Market Research to support the PDA/HNC
    Engineering Practice
    2.2.1 History
    SCOTVEC first introduced an Advanced Certificate/HNC Engineering Practice
    award structure in 1996 as part of a major national development of HN Engineering
    awards which saw the introduction of an overarching HN Engineering Framework.
    In 2006 the SQA introduced a revised Advanced Certificate/HNC Engineering
    Practice award structure which took account of the new SQA, HN Design Principles
    and the latest developments in technology, working and supervisory practices and
    education. The latest development in 2010 has simply resulted in a change of title of
    the four Advanced Certificates to PDAs and a recognition that the four PDAs are at
    SCQF level 7.
    2.2.2 Market Research
    Most of the market research for the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards was
    undertaken in 2005-06 when the revised Advanced Certificate/HNC Engineering
    Practice awards were developed. However, opportunities were taken when
    producing the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice Validation Document to update
    some of the desk based market research with a view to lending further support to the
    development of the four PDAs and the HNC Engineering Practice awards. A brief
    outline of the market research methods used in 2005–2006 and 2009 to support
    award developments are summarised in Table 2.2.

    redevelopment of the awards to include on
    the QDT representatives from all centres
    who delivered the Advanced Certificate
    (now re-titled PDA)/HNC Engineering
    Practice awards. This decision was made
    to ensure that the interests of these centres
    in the redevelopment process were
    represented and so that their experience in
    delivering and assessing the previous
    awards could be used to inform
    redevelopments.
    Employers Consultation took place through a
    questionnaire survey and members of the
    QDT consulting industrial contacts on the
    framework structure and Unit content.
    Higher Education Consultation with university staff revealed
    that the Advanced Certificate (now re-
    titled PDA)/HNC Engineering Practice
    awards have no advanced standing with
    degree courses. In fact, candidates may
    require too supplement the level of
    Mathematics they have studied on the
    Advanced Certificate (now re-titled
    PDA)/HNC Engineering Practice with
    additional Mathematics Unit before they
    are able to enter a degree course.

    Stakeholder Method
    Professional Bodies Representatives of the Institution of
    Engineering and Technology (IET)/The
    Institution of Mechanical Engineers
    (IMechE) have advised the QDT on the
    status of the awards in relation to
    membership of their bodies.
    Candidates While not consulted directly details of
    candidates’ experiences of the previous
    Advanced Certificate/HNC Engineering
    Practice awards were provided by QDT
    members. These experiences were taken
    fully into account in the design of the new
    awards.
    2.3 The Target Client Groups
    The PDA/HNC Engineering Practice suite of awards have been developed
    principally for candidates in employment pursuing careers, at advanced craft and
    engineering supervisory level, in fabrication and welding, engineering manufacture,
    engineering maintenance or electrical engineering. Each of the four PDAs has been
    designed to provide candidates with the opportunities to develop core and specialist
    knowledge, understanding and skills in an advanced engineering craft area. The
    HNC Engineering Practice award allows candidates to develop important
    knowledge and skills needs to become an engineering supervisor or team leader.
    The PDA/HNC Engineering Practice would normally be studied by candidates who
    attend a centre on a day-release or other part-time basis. The PDA/HNC
    Engineering Practice award structures are sufficiently flexible enough to allow
    centres to deliver the awards by various modes of delivery: for example, two-year
    day-release, evening attendance, block-release etc.
    Where centres decide to offer a PDA/HNC Engineering Practice on a full-time basis
    it is strongly recommended that candidates are provided with opportunities to take a
    number of practical engineering Units in conjunction with the Units in the relevant
    PDA so that they acquire some useful practical skills and gain some experience of
    what it would be like to work in a practical engineering environment (s). Centres
    should also arrange appropriate industrial visits for candidates so that they can see
    the applications of subjects learnt on their course in practical engineering situations.
    2.4 Links to National Occupational Standards
    While none of the four PDAs/HNC Engineering Practice awards have been designed
    to match into specific occupational standards in engineering or management, each
    PDA/HNC Engineering Practice award may provide important underpinning
    knowledge and understanding for SVQs in Engineering or Management at level 3.

    For details on employment opportunities see Aim 3.1.1 in Section 3.3 and Aim 3.2.1
    in Section 3.4. For details of progression routes and professional recognition from
    PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards see Aim 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 in Section 3.4 and
    Section 5.6.
    3 Aims of the awards
    The aims of the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards are exactly the same as
    those for the Advanced Certificate/HNC Engineering Practice awards. The general
    and specific aims are shown below.
    3.1 General Aims of the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice
    The general aims of the awards are to:
    3.1.1 Enhance candidates’ employment prospects
    3.1.2 support candidates’ Continuing Professional Development and career
    development
    3.1.3 enable progression within the SCQF (Scottish Credit and Qualifications
    Framework)
    3.1.4 develop candidates’ abilities to apply analysis skills to the solution of
    engineering and supervisory problems
    3.1.5 develop learning and transferable skills (including Core Skills).
    3.2 Specific Aims of the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice
    The specific aims of the awards are to:
    3.2.1 provide awards that will allow candidates to work now, or in the future, at
    advanced engineering craft and supervisory level in an engineering
    environment.
    3.2.2 provide awards that create a route towards meeting the academic
    requirements for Engineering Technician and Incorporated Engineer status.
    3.2.3 develop awards that on successful completion will allow candidates to
    progress to a relevant HNC/HND Engineering or further qualifications in a
    supervisory or management area.
    3.2.4 develop a range of Communication knowledge and skills relevant to the
    needs of advanced engineering craft persons and engineering supervisors.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 7
    3.2.5 on successful completion of the HNC Engineering Practice award, achieve
    the Core Skill of Communication at Higher level. Candidates will also be
    provided with opportunities to develop the following Core Skills:
    Information and Communication Technology, Numeracy, Problem Solving
    and Working with Others.
    3.2.6 develop knowledge, understanding and skills in advanced engineering craft

    3.2.8 develop knowledge, understanding and skills to undertake the role of an
    engineering supervisor in an engineering business environment.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 8
    3.3 How the General Aims are met in the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice Structures and Content
    Aim No. How it is met in the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice
    3.1.1 Advanced Certificate/HNC Engineering Practice (re-titled PDA/HNC Engineering Practice) awards have for a
    number of years equipped candidates to seek employment as advanced craft persons and/or supervisors in a wide
    range of industrial, service and public sector organisations. There are a large number of people (approx 23, 000)
    working as skilled tradespersons in the engineering industry. The PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards have been
    designed to meet many of the education and training needs of such individuals.
    3.1.2 There has been a long tradition of candidates in employment taking HNC Engineering awards on a part-time basis
    to increase their knowledge, understanding and skills in a branch of Engineering and, thus, enhance their technical
    education and career development. The PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards provide a very important route for
    those candidates who wish to enhance their knowledge, understanding and skills in advanced engineering crafts and
    engineering supervisory skills. More specifically the Unit Engineering Supervision: Teamworking and Continuing
    Professional Development within the HNC Engineering Practice award allows some of the key issues associated
    with being an engineering supervisor to be explored and on the basis of their understanding of these issues allows
    candidates to develop a Continuous Professional Development Action Plan with a view to developing their
    supervisory and other knowledge and skills over the following three to five years of their career. CPD action
    planning has been introduced in this Unit to encourage candidates to engage in the CPD process throughout the
    whole of their careers.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 9
    Aim No. How it is met in the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice
    3.1.3 All Units within the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards have been levelled at SCQF levels 6, 7 or 8. The new
    awards also conform to the SQA levelling requirements for PDA/HNC awards.
    3.1.4 The nature of the Engineering discipline lends itself to the development of analysis skills. For example, such skills
    are required by candidates when solving electrical circuit problems or a lighting design, or when solving mechanical
    engineering problems or when working on a fabrication design. Analysis skills are also required at HNC
    Engineering Practice level when, for example, analysing quality costs or reviewing the role of an engineering
    supervisor in different scenarios.
    3.1.5 The new PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards provide centres with an opportunity to enhance learning skills not
    least by creating opportunities for candidates to combine theory and practice to achieve a real understanding of a
    subject. For example, the core engineering Units recommend significant use of practical work and/or computer
    simulation to reinforce learning. It is also anticipated that centres will use innovative delivery approaches that may
    make use of engineering laboratory/workshop equipment and/or on-line delivery and/or Virtual Learning
    Environments to enhance candidate learning. Industrial visits are also highly recommended to consolidate learning
    in the centre.
    By their very nature Engineering courses require the transfer of technical knowledge and skills from one area to
    another. This is particularly the case with the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards where candidates are often
    required to transfer their knowledge of craft engineering principles and technologies from one area to the solution of
    problems in another area of engineering. Candidates will also have an opportunity to use the Communication
    knowledge and skills developed in the mandatory core HN Unit in other parts of the awards to support such
    activities as report writing and working in groups. Core Skills in general, and problem solving in particular, were
    regarded as very important by the QDT since it is recognised that a good level of competence in these is essential in
    the work of advanced craft persons and engineering supervisors.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 10
    3.4 How the Specific Aims are met in the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice Structure and Content
    Aim No. How it is met in the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice
    3.2.1 Advanced Certificate/HNC Engineering Practice awards have been recognised for a number of years by employers
    and other stakeholders of these awards as appropriate qualifications for persons wishing to work at advanced craft
    and engineering supervisory levels in an engineering business environment. Market research indicates that there is
    still a solid demand for people with advanced engineering craft and supervisory skills in Scottish companies. Thus,
    it is confidently anticipated that those achieving the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards will find employment
    as skilled tradespersons or supervisors in a wide range of small, medium and large companies.
    3.2.2
    and
    3.2.3
    The QDT has been advised by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)/The Institution of Mechanical
    Engineers (IMechE) that a PDA/HNC Engineering Practice award partially meets their academic requirements for
    registration as an Incorporated Engineer and may meet fully their academic underpinning requirements for
    registration as an Engineering Technician.
    The QDT was informed by university staff that an Advanced Certificate/HNC Engineering Practice is unlikely to
    give any advanced standing with engineering degree course although studying at 1st year degree level may be a
    possibility. Candidates may have to do additional Mathematics along with their PDA/HNC Engineering Practice to
    gain entry to the first year of a degree course. Alternatively candidates may wish to pursue further studies by
    undertaking an appropriate HNC/HND Engineering qualification. A PDA/HNC Engineering Practice will provide
    some credit transfer opportunities towards such awards, the precise nature of which will depend on the HN
    Engineering award the candidate wishes to study. Following on from the HNC Engineering Practice award
    candidates may wish to pursue supervisory or management qualifications to further their careers as supervisors or
    managers. Individual centres will be able to provide information on what supervisory or management
    qualifications are available at the centre.

    3.2.4 Market research information gathered through various consultations indicates that there continues to be solid
    support for the inclusion of a distinct Communication Unit in the mandatory core of HNC Engineering Practice
    award. The benefit of having a separate Communication Unit is that it significantly improves the prospect of
    sufficient attention being given to the teaching of this key skills area. A separate Unit also makes it possible to
    ensure that the Communication Core Skill at Higher level is fully embedded within the HNC Engineering Practice
    award. Award designers considered this a more appropriate way to ensure that this Core Skill is included in the
    HNC than trying to embed such a Core Skill across, say, a range of engineering Units. It should also be noted that
    opportunities to develop the Communication Core Skill are signposted in a number of the Units in the PDA/HNC
    Engineering Practice awards.
    3.2.5 As noted above, the Communication Core Skill at Higher level has been incorporated into the HNC Engineering
    Practice award through the mandatory core Unit, Communication: Practical Skills.
    Opportunities to develop the Core Skills Numeracy, Information and Communication Technology, Problem
    Solving and Working with Others are signposted within individual Unit specifications. Candidates may achieve the
    Information and Communication Technology Core Skills at Higher level if they take the Unit Information
    Technology: Applications Software 1 in the optional sections of the PDA awards. The Core Skill component
    Using Number can be obtained if a candidate successfully achieves either the Mathematics for Engineering 1:
    Electronic and Electrical or Mathematics for Engineering 1: Mechanical and Manufacturing within the optional
    section of the HNC Engineering Practice.

    Aim No. How it is met in the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice
    3.2.6 Candidates will be provided with opportunities to develop knowledge, understanding and skills in a range of
    engineering craft principles and technologies by undertaking the mandatory Units in a PDA relevant to their area
    of employment or interest. For example, by undertaking the PDA in Engineering Practice: Fabrication and
    Welding at SCQF level 7 candidates will be able to develop knowledge, understanding and skills about welding
    principles and applications, container design and manufacture, inspection systems and steelwork preparation,
    joining and assembly. Candidates undertaking a PDA in Engineering Practice: Engineering Manufacture at SCQF
    level 7 will have the opportunity to develop knowledge, understanding and skills in mechanical engineering
    principles, CAD, CNC and engineering measurement. Candidates studying a PDA in Engineering Practice:
    Engineering Maintenance at SCQF level 7 will have the opportunity to develop knowledge, understanding and
    skills in plant systems services and utilities, mechanical engineering principles and industrial plant maintenance.
    Candidates taking a PDA in Engineering Practice: Electrical Engineering at SCQF level 7 will be able to develop
    knowledge, understanding and skills in electrical engineering principles, use of electrical instruments and
    electrical motors and motor starting.
    3.2.7 Each of the four new PDAs also has an optional section where candidates can choose Units relevant to their area
    of employment, and/or future career or educational development.
    3.2.8 The HNC Engineering Practice has been designed to allow candidates to develop much of the knowledge,
    understanding and skills they require to be an engineering supervisor. Candidates will be able to study such
    subjects as the role of an engineering supervisor in an organisation, effective team working and team leadership,
    constructing a CPD action plan, identifying the differences between Quality Control and Quality Assurance,
    explaining the stages in obtaining ISO 9000, selecting and applying quality improvement tools, applying quality
    cost models and applying Value Engineering techniques to engineering products or processes or services.
    Candidates will also be able to choose one Unit credit from the optional section of the HNC Engineering Practice
    from the following range of subjects: Production Planning and Control, Engineering Supervision: Staff and Budget
    Issues, Mathematics, Workplace Communication in English or Personal Development Planning.

    the mandatory Section of 5.1.2 together with any two Unit credits from the optional
    Section of 5.1.2.
    PDA in Engineering Practice: Engineering Maintenance at SCQF level 7
    A candidate will be awarded a PDA in Engineering Practice: Engineering
    Maintenance at SCQF level 7 on successful completion of the four Unit credits in
    the mandatory Section of 5.1.3 together with any two Unit credits from the optional
    Section of 5.1.3.
    PDA in Engineering Practice: Electrical Engineering at SCQF level 7
    A candidate will be awarded a PDA in Engineering Practice: Electrical Engineering
    at SCQF level 7 on successful completion of the four Unit credits in the mandatory
    Section of 5.1.4 together with any two Unit credits from the optional Section of
    5.1.4.
    HNC Engineering Practice
    A candidate will be awarded an HNC Engineering Practice on successful
    completion of a PDA in Engineering Practice: Fabrication and Welding at SCQF
    level 7 or a PDA in Engineering Practice: Engineering Manufacture at SCQF level 7
    or a PDA in Engineering Practice: Engineering Maintenance at SCQF level 7 or a
    PDA in Engineering Practice: Electrical Engineering at SCQF level 7 and the
    successful achievement of the five mandatory Unit credits plus one Unit credit from
    the optional section of the HNC Engineering Practice award structure shown in
    Section 5.1.5.
    5.3 Core Skills Exit Profile
    PDAs in Engineering Practice
    None of the four PDAs have Core Skills, or Core Skill components, embedded in
    the mandatory core Units of the awards. However, there are opportunities for
    candidates to develop some of the Core Skills components as part of the delivery of
    the mandatory Units as identified in Table 6.1(a). Candidates who achieve the
    optional Information Technology: Applications Software 1 Unit will be awarded
    with the Using Information and Communication Technology Core Skills at Higher.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 25
    Centre staff are asked to refer to individual optional Unit specifications for details of
    other Advanced Certificate Core Skill component development opportunities.
    HNC Engineering Practice
    A candidate who successfully achieves an HNC Engineering Practice will
    automatically obtain the following Core Skill:
    ¨ Communication Higher (fully embedded in the Unit Communication: Practical
    Skills)
    Candidates who achieve either the Mathematics for Engineering 1: Electronic and
    Electrical or Mathematics for Engineering 1: Mechanical and Manufacturing Units
    will automatically be awarded the Core Skills component Using Number at Higher.
    Opportunities for candidates to develop Core Skills components as a part of the
    delivery of the HNC Engineering Practice are shown in Table 6.1(b).
    5.4 SCQF levels
    The four PDAs satisfy the PDA Design Principles as follows:
    All four awards are made up of more than 2 Unit credits (16 SCQF credit points)
    which, therefore, exceed the minimum requirement for PDA at SCQF levels 7–12 to
    be made up of a minimum of 16 SCQF credit points.
    All four PDAs have a mandatory and optional section which reflect the title of each
    award.
    The mandatory cores of the PDA in Engineering Practice: Fabrication and Welding;
    the PDA in Engineering Practice: Engineering Manufacture and the PDA in
    Engineering Practice: Engineering Maintenance are made up of four Unit credits at
    SCQF level 7. Since these mandatory cores represent more than half of the awards
    in terms of SCQF credit points (ie 32 credit points out of 48 credit points) these
    three awards automatically satisfy the PDA design principle that at least half of the
    SCQF credit points will be at the level of the Group Award.
    With regard to the PDA in Engineering Practice: Electrical Engineering two of the
    four Unit credits in the mandatory core are at SCQF level 7 while the other two Unit
    credits are at SCQF level 6. However, all Units in the optional section are at SCQF
    level 7 apart from one which is at SCQF level 6 so that even if a centre includes the
    level 6 Unit in its programme of study, the programme will still have three Unit
    credits (24 SCQF credit points) at SCQF level 7 which satisfies the PDA design rule
    that at least half of the SCQF credit points will be at the level of the Group Award.
    The five mandatory Unit credits within the HNC Engineering Practice (see Section
    5.1.5) are levelled at SCQF level 7, giving 40 SCQF level 7 points. All four PDA
    have as a minimum 2 Unit credits at SCQF level 7 within their mandatory sections
    corresponding to 16 SCQF level 7 points. Thus, any of the four PDA and the HNC
    Engineering Practice combined has at least 56 SCQF level 7 points which satisfies
    the HN Design Principle that an HNC should have a minimum of 48 credits at
    SCQF level 7.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 26
    5.5 Mapping information
    Information on the way in which individual Units map into the aims of the awards
    can be found in the Tables in Sections 3.3 and 3.4.
    5.6 Articulation, professional recognition and credit transfer
    5.6.1 Articulation
    University staff indicated that the previous Advanced Certificate/HNC Engineering
    Practice awards carried no advanced standing with regard to university degree
    courses. In fact, it was commented that candidates may have to supplement the level
    of Mathematics they studied on an Advanced Certificate/HNC Engineering Practice
    award with an additional Mathematics Unit (s) before they would be able to enter a
    degree course. As the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards simply represent a
    change of title there is no reason to believe that universities will have changed their
    position regarding the entry status of the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice with
    respect to their degree programmes.
    Candidates successfully completing a PDA/HNC Engineering Practice award may
    alternatively pursue further studies through an appropriate HN Engineering
    qualification (eg HNC/D Electrical Engineering or HNC/HND Mechanical
    Engineering). A PDA/HNC Engineering Practice will provide some credit transfer
    opportunities towards such awards, the precise nature of which will depend on the
    HN Engineering award the candidate is pursuing. Following on from the HNC
    Engineering Practice award candidates may wish to pursue supervisory or
    management qualifications to further their careers as supervisors or managers.
    Individual centres will be able to provide information on what supervisory or
    management qualifications are available to candidates.
    5.6.2 Professional Body Recognition
    The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)/The Institution of Mechanical
    Engineers (IMechE) have advised that a PDA/HNC Engineering Practice award
    partially meets the underpinning knowledge and understanding requirements for
    registration as an Incorporated Engineer and may meet fully the underpinning
    knowledge and understanding requirements for registration as an Engineering
    Technician.
    5.6.3 Credit Transfer
    Credit transfer arrangements for Units in the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice award
    framework that have already been validated as part of previous HNC/HND Group
    Award validations are shown in the appropriate arrangements documents. Credit
    transfer arrangements between Units in the previous Advanced Certificate/HNC
    Engineering Practice and Units unique to the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice
    awards are shown in Table 5.6 on the following pages.

    6 Approaches to delivery and assessment
    6.1 Delivery
    As mentioned in Section 2.3 the QDT were firmly of the view that the PDA/HNC
    Engineering Practice suite of awards are principally for candidates in employment
    and would, therefore, normally be studied by candidates who attend a centre on a
    day-release or other part-time basis. The PDA/HNC Engineering Practice award
    structures are sufficiently flexible enough to allow centres to deliver the awards by
    various modes of delivery for example, two-year day-release, evening attendance,
    block-release etc.
    Where centres decide to offer a PDA/HNC Engineering Practice on a full-time basis
    it is strongly recommended that candidates are provided with opportunities to take a
    number of practical engineering Units in conjunction with Units in the relevant
    award structure so that they can acquire some useful practical skills and gain some
    exposure to what it may be like working in a practical engineering environment (s).
    Centres are also encouraged to arrange a number of industrial visits for their
    candidates so that they can see some applications of subjects learnt on their course
    in practical engineering environments.
    With regard to timetabling centres may timetable a PDA and the HNC Engineering
    Practice in sequence (ie the six PDA Units first followed by the six HNC
    Engineering Practice Units) as illustrated in the first timetable for a PDA in
    Engineering Practice: Engineering Manufacture at SCQF level 7/HNC Engineering
    Practice in Appendix 1. Alternatively, centres may mix the timetabling of a PDA
    and HNC Engineering Practice Units to meet different candidate and employer
    needs as illustrated in the second timetable for the PDA in Engineering Practice:
    Electrical Engineering at SCQF level 7/HNC Engineering Practice in Appendix 1.
    Centres should take account of information contained in the Recommended Prior
    Knowledge and Skills statements in Unit specifications in sequencing the delivery
    of Units (eg it would be normal to deliver the Electrical Engineering Principles 1
    Unit before the Electrical Engineering Principles 2 Unit).
    Centres, working on their own or in partnership, might also wish to consider the
    following approaches to delivering the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards:
    ¨ Identification and sharing of good candidate learning support materials on the
    internet
    ¨ Use of the Internet by candidates to undertake more in-depth investigations in
    given subject areas
    ¨ Development or purchase of paper based and/or electronic candidate learning
    support and assessment materials for individual Units (eg for certain optional
    Units)
    ¨ Development of on-line Unit and Graded Unit assessment materials
    ¨ Use of e-mentoring arrangements to support candidates who study at a distance
    One of the key reasons the QDT has sought to reduce the time candidates have to
    spend on summative Unit assessment is to provide lecturers with more time to
    deliver Units. Lecturers are encouraged, in particular, to use this additional time to
    reinforce learning in core engineering and supervisory concepts and principles and
    in the transfer of knowledge, understanding and skills across subject boundaries.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 31
    Lecturers may use a variety of teaching and learning approaches in delivering the
    Units in the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice awards. These may include lecturing,
    group work, laboratory and practical work, computer simulation (using appropriate
    software packages), project work and case studies. The use of open and distance
    learning and on-line materials may help to supplement and support the learning that
    takes place in the classroom, laboratory or workshop.
    Lecturers should also seek opportunities to integrate Core Skills within their
    teaching and learning programmes. Such opportunities may include the following: -
    Communication
    ¨ Providing candidates opportunities to develop their oral skills by allowing them
    to give full answers to questions asked by the lecturer
    ¨ Developing complex, vocationally specific reading skills (eg Communication:
    Practical Skills.)
    ¨ Developing report writing skills in a number of Units (eg Computer Aided
    Manufacture, Value Engineering)
    ¨ Allowing candidates to develop their Communication skills in group work
    activities (eg Communication: Practical Skills, Engineering Supervision:
    Teamworking and Continuing Professional Development)
    Numeracy
    ¨ Reinforcing Numeracy and Mathematical skills when teaching engineering
    principles (eg Mechanical Engineering Principles, Electrical Engineering
    Principles 1, Electrical Engineering Principles 2)
    ¨ Reinforcing Using Graphical Information skills by use of a range of graphical
    representations (eg Electrical Installation Design (Computer Aided): An
    Introduction, Containers: Design and Manufacture)
    Information and Communication Technology
    ¨ Develop Information and Communication Technology skills through the
    application of IT within engineering systems (eg Computer Aided Draughting
    for Engineers, Quality Management: An Introduction)
    Problem Solving Skills
    ¨ Develop Critical Thinking Skills through the application of engineering
    concepts and principles to solve engineering systems (eg Lighting Design in
    Buildings, Value Engineering)
    ¨ Develop Planning and Organisational Skills within an engineering and
    supervisory context (eg Industrial Plant Maintenance, Engineering Supervision:
    Teamworking and Continuing Professional Development)
    ¨ Develop review and evaluation skills within an engineering and supervisory
    context (eg Inspection Systems, Value Engineering)
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 32
    Working with Others
    ¨ Develop Working with Others skills through identifying approaches to
    developing high performance team and group discussions on the solution to
    engineering problems (eg Engineering Supervision: Teamworking and
    Continuing Professional Development, Containers: Design and Manufacture)
    Opportunities for candidates to develop some Core Skills components as part of the
    delivery of PDA mandatory Units are identified in Table 6.1(a). Likewise Core Skill
    component development opportunities within the HNC Engineering Practice are
    shown in Table 6.1(b). Centre staff are asked to refer to individual optional Unit
    specifications for details of other PDA/HNC Engineering Practice Core Skill
    component development opportunities.

    6.2 Assessment
    6.2.1 Introduction
    From the outset of developments the QDT recognised the need to have an
    appropriate assessment strategy in place for the Advanced Certificate/HNC
    Engineering Practice (now re-titled PDA/HNC Engineering Practice) awards. Such
    a strategy was developed and is shown below:
    Aims
    The aims of the strategy are to ensure that:
    1 consistent, rigorous and efficient approaches are adopted to the development
    and administration of PDA/HN Engineering Practice assessment instruments at
    both Unit and Graded Unit levels, which satisfy nationally agreed standards;
    2 the assessment load on candidates and staff is sensible and that assessment does
    not unduly detract from teaching and learning;
    3 as far as possible reliable and rigorous moderation processes are put in place in
    order to ensure that consistent national standards are achieved for all
    PDA/HNC Engineering Practice assessments.
    Objectives
    Listed below are the measures that have been put in place to meet the aims:
    1 Develop nationally one assessment exemplar pack for the mandatory Units in
    each of the PDA and the HNC Engineering Practice that clearly sets out the
    standards of assessment expected in Units.
    2 Adopt a holistic approach to Unit assessment. The implications of this are as
    follows:
    i Assessment instruments will normally be designed only to sample
    knowledge and skills in a Unit (this is consistent with the new HN Unit
    format)
    ii A Unit assessment strategy will be adopted, where possible, to produce a
    single assessment instrument for the whole Unit. Where this is not possible
    the assessment strategy will seek to ensure that the minimum number of
    assessment instruments is required consistent with maintaining agreed
    national standards.
    3 Whilst not seeking to be entirely prescriptive with regard to the time spent on
    assessment in each HN Unit, over assessment should be avoided if the
    following guideline is adopted for the maximum time spent on HN Unit
    assessment:
    One and a half hours per Unit credit for HN Units at SCQF levels 6 and 7 and
    two hours per Unit credit for HN Units at SCQF level 8.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 38
    4 Produce assessment exemplar packs for the Graded Unit. In addition, for the
    Graded Unit examination produce at least one sample exam paper to show the
    standards expected in such a paper
    5 Actively encourage centres to work in partnership in producing Graded Unit
    assessment materials, which meet nationally agreed standards reducing, in turn,
    the workload on staff in individual colleges.
    6 Ensure that consistent and rigorous internal and external moderation procedures
    operate through both HN Unit level and Graded Unit assessment processes.
    This places a clear responsibility on both centres and the SQA.
    As far as has been practical the above objectives have been adhered to when
    developing assessment exemplar and Graded Unit materials.
    6.2.2 Graded Units
    The purpose of the Graded Unit within the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice award
    structure is to assess the candidate’s ability to apply and integrate knowledge and/or
    skills gained within individual Units. By this means candidates will demonstrate that
    they have achieved the aims of the awards as detailed in Section 3. The Graded Unit
    also provides the means by which candidate achievement can be graded.
    PDA/HNC Engineering Practice candidates will undertake a one credit Graded Unit
    at SCQF level 7. This will be in the form of a 3-hour written examination.
    Engineering Practice: Graded Unit 1 — Examination
    The specifications for the Engineering Practice: Graded Unit 1 can be found on the
    SQA website (www.sqa.org.uk). The Graded Unit draws on the Outcomes in the
    mandatory sections of the relevant PDA and the HNC Engineering Practice award.
    The examination paper consists of the following two sections:
    Section A;
    Section B.
    Section A should be subdivided into up to four individual sub-sections to reflect the
    four different engineering disciplines candidates may have studied at PDA level:
    namely Fabrication and Welding, Engineering Manufacture, Engineering
    Maintenance and Electrical Engineering. Each sub-section should comprise of a
    suitable balance of between 8 to 12 short answer, restricted response and structured
    questions. Candidates should answer all questions in the relevant sub-section of
    Section A. Candidates should be able to score up to a maximum of 50% from the
    sub-section they have answered questions from.
    Section B should comprise of a Case Study based around the HNC Engineering
    Practice mandatory Units in which candidates have to answer questions on
    appropriate engineering supervisory issues and problems. All candidates,
    irrespective of which engineering discipline they have studied at PDA level, should
    answer all questions in Section B. The question paper associated with the Case
    Study should comprise of between 6 and 10 restricted response questions.
    Candidates should be able to score a maximum of 50% from Section B. Candidates
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 39
    should be given a copy of the Case Study only, a minimum of 14-days before they
    sit the examination.
    The examination should be conducted under closed-book, supervised conditions
    with candidates only being allowed to bring into the examination up to 3 sides of A4
    hand written notes they have prepared on the Case Study. These notes should be
    handed to the invigilator at the end of the examination. Candidates should be
    allowed to bring a scientific calculator into the examination.
    It is recommended that candidates do not sit the Graded Unit examination until the
    end of the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice programme of study given the range of
    Units that the Graded Unit draws on.

    been produced for DW92 34 Engineering Practice: Graded Unit 1.
    6.2.4 Formative Assessment
    Formative assessment should be used throughout the delivery of Units to reinforce
    learning, build candidates’ confidence and prepare candidates for summative
    assessment.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 40
    6.3 Resources
    Practical Resources
    Centre staff are advised to read individual Unit specifications carefully to identify
    the consumables, equipment and/or software requirements to deliver Units. Some
    Units have specific requirements. For example, the Computer Aided Draughting in
    Engineering and Electrical Installation Design (Computer Aided): An Introduction
    require candidates to use industrially specific software. The Computer Integrated
    Manufacture Unit requires candidates to be able to access CNC equipment.
    While not all Units require practical resources, centres are strongly recommended to
    provide candidates with access to practical workshop facilities appropriate to the
    particular PDA. For example, candidates undertaking the PDA in Engineering
    Practice: Fabrication and Welding at SCQF level 7 should have access to practical
    fabrication and welding facilities. Such access will allow candidates to relate the
    theory they are being taught to practice.
    When teaching subjects such as pumps, fans, electrical motors etc centres should
    allow candidates to view disassembled equipment so that they can gain a greater
    appreciation of the construction of these items of plant. A good chart or other visual
    aid showing the various parts of an item of plant can also be a very good teaching
    aid.
    The QDT strongly recommend the use of simulation software to support teaching
    and learning. However, the Team do not believe that such software should be used
    at the expense of practical workshop and laboratory activities. The Team strongly
    considers that such practical activities represent the best way for candidates to relate
    the theory they learn in the classroom to practical engineering.
    The QDT believe that there is a very rich and varied range of teaching and learning
    resources available to deliver individual PDA and HNC Engineering Practice Units.
    Such learning resources include textbooks, reports, papers, standards, CDs, DVDs
    and numerous sites on the Internets. Some centres may already have good learning
    resources in their learning libraries/Virtual Learning Environments. It is anticipated
    that the Qualification Support Team (QST) for the PDA/HNC Engineering Practice
    will provide a useful forum for the identification and sharing of learning resources.
    Continuing Professional Development
    The QDT are firmly of the view that active staff CPD is essential if the delivery and
    assessment of individual PDAs and HNC Engineering Practice Units are to be kept
    up to date, relevant and interesting. Staff CPD activities could be in subject areas
    such as the following (the list is not intended to be exhaustive):
    ¨ Learning to use specialist engineering software
    ¨ Modern manufacturing methods
    ¨ New or revised standards and regulations
    ¨ Issues relating to health and safety
    ¨ Quality Control and Quality Assurance
    ¨ Value Engineering
    ¨ New teaching and assessment methodologies
    ¨ E-learning
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 41
    6.4 Open and Distance Learning
    Advice on the use of open and distance learning is given in individual Unit
    specifications. However, where it is used with regard to assessment, planning would
    be required by the centre concerned to ensure the sufficiency and authenticity of
    candidate evidence. Arrangement would be required to be put in place to ensure that
    the assessment or assessments were conducted under the conditions specified in the
    Unit specification. For example, in the case of a Unit which involved a Unit end test
    a centre would have to make arrangements for the test to be conducted under
    controlled, supervised conditions. Likewise, where a Unit involves a practical based
    assessment, a centre would have to make arrangements for candidates to come into
    the centre, or another appropriate venue, to undertake the assessment under the
    conditions specified in the Unit specification.
    It should be noted that the same requirements as specified in the previous paragraph
    apply where part or all of a Unit is delivered on-line.
    7 General information for centres
    Candidates with disabilities and/or additional support needs
    The additional support needs of individual candidates should be taken into account
    when planning learning experiences, selecting assessment instruments, or
    considering alternative Outcomes for Units. Further advice can be found in the SQA
    document Guidance on Assessment Arrangements for Candidates with Disabilities
    and/or Additional Support Needs (www.sqa.org.uk).
    Internal and external moderation
    All instruments of assessment used within this/these Group Award(s) should be
    internally moderated, using the appropriate policy within the centre and the
    guidelines set by SQA.
    External moderation will be carried out by SQA to ensure that internal assessment is
    within the national guidelines for these qualifications.
    Further information on internal and external moderation can be found in SQA’s
    Guide to Assessment (www.sqa.org.uk).
    8 General information for candidates
    The new Professional Development Award (PDA)/HNC Engineering Practice
    awards have been designed by an expert team of educators and industrialists with a
    view to allowing you to meet the educational and training requirements to work as
    an advanced craftsperson and engineering supervisor. The new qualifications
    contain up-to-date and relevant engineering and supervisory subject content and
    skills and have also been designed to satisfy the new SQA PDA/Higher National
    Design Principles.
    The PDA/HNC Engineering Practice award structure consists of four, 6-credit PDAs
    in Fabrication and Welding or Engineering Manufacture or Engineering
    Maintenance or Electrical Engineering. Each of these four PDAs is at SCQF level 7.
    You should choose to study the PDA which best meets your employment and
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 42
    educational requirements. Regardless of which PDA you study, you will, along with
    other candidates, study the single 6-credit HNC Engineering Practice. To obtain a
    PDA you must successfully achieve the 6-credits in the relevant PDA award
    framework. To achieve an HNC Engineering Practice you must achieve a PDA and
    the 6-Unit credits in the HNC Engineering Practice.
    Studying a PDA will allow you to develop your knowledge, understanding and
    skills in your chosen advanced engineering craft discipline. Each PDA consists of a
    4-credit mandatory section and an optional section where you can choose two Unit
    credits from a range of Units to suit your employment and education needs. The
    mandatory sections of the four PDAs contain the subjects shown in the table below:
    PDA Subjects in Mandatory section
    PDA in Engineering Practice:
    Fabrication and Welding at SCQF
    level 7
    Welding principles and applications,
    container design and manufacture,
    inspection systems and fabrication
    steelwork preparation, joining and
    assembly
    PDA in Engineering Practice:
    Engineering Manufacture at SCQF level
    7
    Mechanical engineering principles, CAD,
    CNC and engineering measurement
    PDA in Engineering Practice:
    Engineering Maintenance at SCQF
    level 7
    Plant Systems: services and utilities,
    mechanical engineering principles and
    industrial plant maintenance.
    PDA in Engineering Practice:
    Electrical Engineering at SCQF level 7
    Electrical principles, applications of
    electrical and electronic instruments and
    electric motors and motor starting
    In the HNC Engineering Practice you will be provided with opportunities to develop
    much of the knowledge, understanding and skills to become an engineering
    supervisor. Five Unit credits in the HNC Engineering Practice are mandatory. These
    Units are Communication: Practical Skills, Engineering Supervision: Teamworking
    and Continuing Professional Development, Quality Management: An introduction,
    Value Engineering and the Engineering Practice examination. You will be able to
    choose one Unit in the HNC Engineering Practice from the following options:
    Mathematics (with either an electrical or mechanical bias), further supervisory
    studies in staffing and budget control, Production Planning and Control, Workplace
    Communication in English or Personal Development Planning.
    The teaching and learning processes that your lecturers are likely to use on a
    PDA/HNC Engineering Practice are as follows: lecturing, group work, practical
    engineering work, measurement and testing, computer simulation and project work.
    Industrial visits may also be included in your programme of study to allow you to
    see ‘real life’ engineering in action.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 43
    The Qualifications Design Team has ensured that assessment in the awards meet
    national standards. The awards have been designed to optimise assessment so that
    sufficient time is available for you to learn the advanced engineering craft and
    supervisory knowledge and skills that are essential to being a good craft/trades
    person and engineer supervisor.
    You can expect to do assessment at individual Unit level and at qualification level.
    At Unit level assessments will normally consist of written tests and/or practical
    exercises which will include the preparation of reports. Your lecturer should tell you
    at the start of the Unit what form Unit assessment(s) will take. In addition to Unit
    assessment there will also be a 3-hour examination. This examination will be
    designed to assess you on your knowledge, understanding and skills in your chosen
    advanced craft area and in the HNC Engineering Practice award. You should ask
    your lecturer for more details about the composition of the examination paper and
    when you will sit it.
    The Qualification Design Team does not wish to place any artificial barriers in the
    way of potential candidates wanting to study a PDA/HNC Engineering Practice
    award. However, it would be unfair to enrol a candidate into a PDA/HNC who did
    not have a realistic chance of successfully achieving the awards. The Qualification
    Design Team would therefore recommend that a candidate had one of the following
    qualifications before entering a PDA/HNC Engineering:
    1 One Higher from Physics, Technological Studies or Mathematics and at least
    three Standard Grades 1–2/Intermediate 2 passes including Mathematics,
    Physics/Technological Studies and English.
    2 An appropriate National Certificate in Engineering Practice or Engineering or
    an appropriate National Certificate in Engineering at SCQF level 5.
    3 Equivalent qualifications or experience to those shown in (1) and (2).
    On completion of your PDA/HNC Engineering Practice award there may be
    opportunities for you to progress to a ‘Higher National technician qualification’ in,
    say, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering if that is what you prefer to do. Your
    PDA/HNC Engineering Practice qualification should provide you with some credit
    transfer opportunities towards the ‘technician HNC/HND.’ The precise nature of
    credit transfer will depend on the HNC/HND you decide to study.
    Alternatively, on completion of your PDA/HNC Engineering Practice award, you
    may decide to study a supervisory or management qualification. Many centres offer
    such qualifications and you are advised to obtain further information from centres
    on the range of supervisory or management qualifications they offer.
    Arrangements Document: PDA/HNC Engineering Practice 44
    9 Glossary of terms
    SCQF: This stands for the Scottish Credit and Qualification Framework, which is a
    new way of speaking about qualifications and how they inter-relate. We use SCQF
    terminology throughout this guide to refer to credits and levels. For further
    information on the SCQF visit the SCQF website at www.scqf.org.uk
    SCQF credits: One HN credit is equivalent to 8 SCQF credit points. This applies to
    all HN Units, irrespective of their level.
    SCQF levels: The SCQF covers 12 levels of learning. HN Units will normally be at
    levels 6–9. Graded Units will be at level 7 and 8.
    Subject Unit: Subject Units contain vocational/subject content and are designed to
    test a specific set of knowledge and skills.
    Graded Unit: Graded Units assess candidates’ ability to integrate what they have
    learned while working towards the Units of the Group Award. Their purpose is to
    add value to the Group Award, making it more than the sum of its parts, and to
    encourage candidates to retain and adapt their skills and knowledge.
    Dedicated Core Skill Unit: This is a Unit that is written to cover one or more
    particular Core Skills, eg HN Units in Information Technology or Communications.
    Embedded Core Skills: This is where the development of a Core Skill is
    incorporated into the Unit and where the Unit assessment also covers the
    requirements of Core Skill assessment at a particular level.
    Signposted Core Skills: This refers to the opportunities to develop a particular
    Core Skill at a specified level that lie outwith automatic certification.
    Qualification Design Team: The QDT works in conjunction with a Qualification
    Manager/Development Manager to steer the development of the HNC/D from its
    inception/revision through to validation. The group is made up of key stakeholders
    representing the interests of centres, employers, universities and other relevant
    organisations.
    Consortium-devised HNCs and HNDs are those developments or revisions
    undertaken by a group of centres in partnership with SQA.
    Specialist single centre and specialist collaborative devised HNCs and HNDs
    are those developments or revisions led by a single centre or small group of centres
    who provide knowledge and skills in a specialist area. Like consortium-devised
    HNCs and HNDs, these developments or revisions will also be supported by SQA.

    respective power factors.
    ♦Investigate consequences of loads with poor power factor and the advantages of
    applying power factor corrections.
    ♦Recognise the effects of perturbations and harmonics within AC systems and describe
    methods to measure and reduce harmonics.
    ♦Demonstrate the need to protect the power distribution network from the effects of
    overload or damage, and identify the requirements of a robust protection system.
    ♦Evaluate the impedance of an AC transmission line, its power losses and its effect on the
    power delivered, including:
    — calculating inductance and capacitance for two types of transmission line
    — performing calculations to determine each of the following secondary parameters:
    Zo, γ, α, β and ν
    Outcome 3
    For this outcome, you must assess two of the three items:
    ♦Calculate incident, reflected and transmitted values of:

    Unit Specification — Electrostatics and Electromagnetics (SCQF level 6) 5

    National Unit Specification: support notes

    UNIT Electrostatics and Electromagnetics (SCQF level 6)

    This part of the Unit Specification is offered as guidance. The support notes are not mandatory.

    While the exact time allocated to this Unit is at the discretion of the centre, the notional design length

    is 40 hours.

    GUIDANCE ON THE CONTENT AND CONTEXT FOR THIS UNIT

    This Unit has been developed as optional Unit in the National Certificate Group Award in Electrical

    Engineering. The Unit is one of a series of units in the area of Electrical Principles. Other units in this

    series include:

    Electrical Principles at SCQF level 5

    Electrical Principles at SCQF level 6

    Single Phase and Three Phase at SCQF level 6

    Circuit Element Principles at SCQF level 6

    Network Analysis at SCQF level 6

    The aim of the Unit is to allow candidates to develop their knowledge and understanding of the

    concepts and principles associated with electrostatic and electromagnetic fields. Candidate will also

    learn how to solve problems involving parallel plate capacitors, capacitors in series and parallel, series

    magnetic circuits, self and mutual inductance and coupling of coils.

    In delivering the Unit centres should encourage candidates to develop a sound knowledge and

    understanding of the basic concepts, principles and formulae associated with electric and magnetic

    fields since these are relevant to many areas of electrical and electronic engineering. Such

    understanding can be enhanced if lecturers relate these concepts and ideas to practical examples

    involving electric and magnetic fields taken from domestic and industrial applications.

    To reinforce learning lecturers may wish to compare electrostatic and electromagnetic quantities

    although such comparisons should not be assessed in the Unit. Similarly lecturers may wish to

    compare quantities in magnetic circuit calculations with those in electric circuit calculations although

    once again this should not be assessed.

    There may be opportunities to integrate the delivery of this Unit with some of the other Electrical

    Principles units in the NCGA Electrical Engineering. For example, it may be possible to link some of

    the subject matter in this Unit to that taught in the Circuit Element Principles (SCQF level 6) Unit.

    GUIDANCE ON LEARNING AND TEACHING APPROACHES FOR THIS UNIT

    This Unit may be delivered by a combination of lectures, worked examples, tutorial exercises and

    laboratory exercises. The Unit could be delivered in a classroom and/or electrical laboratory. Practical

    experimental work can play a particularly important role in reinforcing candidate learning. Candidates

    should be allowed to examine the construction of different types of capacitors and inductors. Good

    diagrams, wall charts and other forms of visual aids will help candidates to learn about electric and

    magnetic fields and the construction of capacitors and inductors. The Internet also provides a rich

    source of information on electric and electromagnetic fields, capacitors and inductors.

    Unit Specification — Electrostatics and Electromagnetics (SCQF level 6) 6

    National Unit Specification: support notes (cont)

    UNIT Electrostatics and Electromagnetics (SCQF level 6)

    OPPORTUNITIES FOR CORE SKILL DEVELOPMENT

    Numeracy skills will be naturally enhanced in this Unit, with the focus on electric and

    electromagnetic field theory and the practical interpretation and application of number and graphics.

    Candidates have to work confidently with complex numerical and graphical concepts, carrying out a

    number of sustained calculations to determine solutions to a range of problems. Formative activities

    should be designed to develop accuracy and confidence in electrical engineering contexts.

    GUIDANCE ON APPROACHES TO ASSESSMENT FOR THIS UNIT

    Opportunities for the use of e-assessment

    E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we mean

    assessment which is supported by information and communications technology (ICT), such as

    e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or e-checklists. Centres which wish to use e-assessment must

    ensure that the national standard is applied to all candidate evidence and that conditions of assessment

    as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met, regardless of the mode of gathering evidence.

    Further advice is available in SQA Guidelines on Online Assessment for Further Education (AA1641,

    March 2003), SQA Guidelines on e-assessment for Schools (BD2625, June 2005).

    Formative assessment exercises involving candidates in solving problems associated with parallel

    plate capacitors, series parallel capacitor networks, series magnetic circuits, self and mutual

    inductance and magnetic coupling will play a particularly important role in building candidate

    knowledge, understanding and confidence of Unit content.

    The suggested approach to summative assessment in this Unit is as follows:

    Outcomes 1 and 2 — an assessment paper comprising a balance of short answer, restricted response,

    and structured questions lasting 1 hour and 15 minutes. The assessment should

    be conducted at a single assessment event.

    Outcomes 3 and 4 — an assessment paper comprising a balance of short answer, restricted response,

    and structured questions lasting 1 hour and 15 minutes. The assessment should

    be conducted at a single assessment event.

    CANDIDATES WITH DISABILITIES AND/OR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT NEEDS

    The additional support needs of individual candidates should be taken into account when planning

    learning experiences, selecting assessment instruments, or considering alternative Outcomes for Units.

    Further advice can be found in the SQA document Guidance on Assessment Arrangements for

    Candidates with Disabilities and/or Additional Support Needs (www.sqa.org.uk).

Links to National Occupational Standards
National Occupational Standards (NOS) are developed by the key employment sectors of the
United Kingdom. These standards set the competences required for job roles within a
particular employment sector.
The NOS for the energy sector (eg Occupational and Functional Map of the UK Renewable
Energy Sector) reflect common requirements in the demonstration of competences across
that sector.
Some of these competences, which are identified in the current NOS, are reflected to varying
degrees in this course. For example:
 General engineering skills.
 A combination of integrated electrical installation and plumbing skills.
 Mechanical skills.
Additionally, other generic skills included in the NOS are reflected throughout the course
including:
 Communication skills.
 Using IT to exchange information.
 Team working skills.
 Ability to learn.
 Ability to follow instructions.
 Organising own learning and development.
Further details are provided in the ‘Rationale’ section.
Equality and inclusion
This Course Arrangements Specification has been designed to ensure that there are no
unnecessary barriers to learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be
taken into account when planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or
considering alternative evidence. Further advice can be found on our website
www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.October 2018, version 3.0

 Skills and knowledge in a broad vocational area.
 Skills for learning, skills for life and skills for work.
 Core Skills.
 An understanding of the workplace.
 Positive attitudes to learning.
 Skills and attitudes for employability.
A key feature of these courses is the emphasis on experiential learning. This means learning
through practical experience and learning by reflecting on experience.
Learning through practical experience
Teaching/learning programmes should include some or all of the following:
 Learning in real or simulated workplace settings.
 Learning through role play activities in vocational contexts.
 Carrying out case study work.
 Planning and carrying out practical tasks and assignments.
Learning through reflecting at all stages of the experience
Teaching/learning programmes should include some or all of the following:
 Preparing and planning for the experience.
 Taking stock throughout the experience, reviewing and adapting as necessary.
 Reflecting after the activity has been completed, evaluating and identifying learning
points.
The Skills for Work courses are also designed to provide learners with opportunities for
developing Core Skills, and Skills for Learning, Skills for Life and Skills for Work with a focus
on enhancing skills and attitudes for employability.October 2018, version 3.0

sectors. The course will allow learners to develop a range of employability skills which are of
particular relevance to energy industries. Core Skills of Information and Communication
Technology and Problem Solving will also be developed throughout the course where
opportunities arise. The course will offer a variety of approaches to learning and teaching
and will include a strong element of experiential learning. It is intended that some of the
course will be delivered and assessed in a different learning environment to that of the
school through a partnership arrangement with a college, training provider, or employer.
There are many technologies used in the production of energy and this course has been
designed to contain both an electrical generation practical/skills element using wind turbines
and a heat generation practical/skills element using solar panels. These elements were
selected to ensure learners receive a range of skills using different technologies that are
involved in the generation of energy. Other systems used to generate energy from both the
traditional/conventional and renewable systems will be discussed and evaluated during the
course.
The general aims of the course are to:
 Widen participation in vocationally-related learning for 14–16 year olds.
 Allow learners to experience vocationally-related learning.
 Provide learners with a broad introduction to the energy sector.
 Allow learners the opportunity to develop skills relevant to the microgeneration energy

across the course with each unit aiming to enhance such skills. The development of
teamwork and practical skills and carrying out test procedures are also given high profile.
The mandatory units in this course introduce the various energy industries based in the UK,
develop practical skills by building a small scale solar hot water system and wind turbine, and
learners will also review their employability skills and evaluate their strengths and
weaknesses. There is an opportunity to specialise in one subject area by selecting one of the
three optional units, ie analyse their own carbon footprint or develop a deeper knowledge of
oil and gas production in the North Sea or develop further knowledge on the conventional
energy generation systems used in the UK.
Summary of unit content
Units are statements of standards for assessment and not programmes of learning and
teaching. They can be delivered in a variety of ways; however Skills for Work units are
designed to provide an experiential learning process.
Energy: An Introduction (National 5) — Mandatory
The aim of the unit is to provide learners with an overview of where we get our energy from,
the engineering systems that convert it into a more convenient form, and the energy
conversion processes that take place from fuel being input to energy being generated.
It gives a broad overview of traditional and renewable energy systems, energy conservation
and includes an evaluation of an industrial or domestic energy generation facility.
Investigation and presentation skills are developed in this unit.
Energy: Domestic Solar Hot Water Systems (National 5) — Mandatory
The unit introduces a microgeneration system which generates heat from solar energy and
transfers this heat energy to a heat exchanger and on to other appliances, eg hot water tank
or under-floor heating system suitable for use in a domestic or small scale industrial building.
This is a practical skills based unit which gives students the practical skills to manufacture
some of the parts and assemble a small solar hot water panel through team working which is
seen as an essential element in this unit.
Energy: Domestic Wind Turbine Systems (National 5) — Mandatory
This unit introduces residential or microgeneration wind turbine systems which generate
electrical energy. This is a practical skills based unit which will give students the ability to
wire up an electrical circuit, manufacture parts, assemble, and test a small scale wind
turbine. The learners will use prepared components to build the turbine. Team working is
seen as an essential element in this unit.
Energy: Employability and Careers (National 5) — Mandatory
Learners will review their performance in the employability skills undertaken in significant
practical activities in the units throughout the course and evaluate their own strengths and
weaknesses. It will also involve students investigating careers and job roles within the energy
sector.October 2018, version 3.0
9
Energy and the Individual (National 5) — Optional
Learners will investigate the energy they use over an average year. This will include
producing their own carbon footprint. From the data gained, they will review and evaluate
their lifestyles to try and reduce the energy they consume and thereby reduce the size of
their carbon emissions/footprint. Presentation skills will also be developed in this unit.
Energy: Oil/Gas Extraction (National 5) — Optional
Learners will be introduced to the formation of oil and gas fields and the sustainability of
these fields, and the type of platform construction used on offshore installations. The
methods used to extract oil and gas including drilling, mud, and fluid control will also be
investigated.
Energy: Conventional Technologies and the Grid (National 5) — Optional
Learners will investigate how conventional energy generation plants support the UK’s total
energy needs and review the effect each of them has on the environment. They will
investigate systems used to generate electricity using coal, oil, gas, hydro, and nuclear
energy as a power source. The national grid and the distribution of energy/power will be
investigated from both present, and projected, future needs.
Conditions of award
To achieve the award of National 5 Skills for Work Energy, learners must achieve all the

Course support notes
Course support notes are not mandatory; they provide advice and guidance on approaches
to delivering and assessing the Skills for Work course. They are intended for teachers and
lecturers who are delivering the course and its units.
Guidance on approaches to delivery and assessment for this
course
Centres should ensure that an induction to the course is given which will enable learners to
understand fully what is required and the approaches to be adopted. It is important that
employability skills, both generic and specific to the energy industries, are stressed at this
time.
Sequencing/integration of units
While the sequence of delivery of the units is for individual centres to decide, it is
recommended that Energy: An Introduction (National 5) unit is offered first. This unit sets the
scene for the other units to be delivered in the context of the energy sector and the energy
people use. All teachers, lecturers and assessors involved in the delivery and assessment of
this course should have an appreciation of the nature and content of the whole course. This
is particularly important in the delivery of the Energy: Employability and Careers (National 5)
unit. It is intended that the evidence requirements for this unit will be drawn from the other
units in the course.
Guidance on approaches to delivery
The course has been designed to ensure that learners learn through practical experiences
where possible. The main focus in each of the skills specific units is on practical work.
General vocational skills, such as selecting and maintaining tools and equipment, are
integrated with practical engineering activities within the units.
Energy: An Introduction (National 5) includes practical lab work where learners will gain a
greater understanding of the principles of energy conversion and how we can generate more
useful forms of energy that can be used in a range of energy production processes.
Learners should be encouraged to investigate energy related topics, including careers, within
the energy sector, and the effect energy production has on the environment or climate
change.
Health and safety is integral to all practical tasks and should be emphasised at the start of,
and throughout, each lesson. Brief lessons on workshop protocol should also be included at
the start of the practical units and at appropriate points during these units.
Teaching and learning approaches will include demonstrations of practical work by tutors.
Short lessons on specific aspects of industrial practice and the correct use of tools will prove
invaluable at intervals throughout the learning experience. These may be followed by brief
practical sessions in which the learners practise the skill emphasised by the demonstration.
Given the practical nature of teaching/learning and assessment, centres should ensure that
teaching blocks are of sufficient time to allow a meaningful experience for learners.
Reflecting on practical experiences and learning from them is an approach that is embedded
in the course. Throughout the learning experiences, the emphasis should be on helping
learners to develop an awareness of the employability skills and attitudes needed for the
energy industry, for example, good timekeeping, co-operating with others, team working, October 2018, version 3.0
15
taking instructions, and a positive attitude to learning. Opportunities to develop these skills
and attitudes arise naturally in the work during the course. Learners should be aware that
these generic skills are just as important as the practical skills they are developing. For
example, it is important for workshop activities to be carried out to effective schedules;
learners will have opportunities to demonstrate good timekeeping in the context of these
schedules. Learners will have to co-operate with others regarding shared workspace, tools
and equipment. They will have to co-operate and communicate regarding the transfer of
materials, tools, and equipment safely around and across the workshop. Learners will be
encouraged to develop a positive attitude to reducing waste and reduce their impact on the
environment with regard to the use of materials and the consumption of energy.
Teaching and learning approaches should encourage learners to take responsibility for their
own learning and development. In the practical units of the course, learners need to carry out
quality checks on their own work. This provides a good opportunity to motivate learners to
take pride in their work. The integration of employability skills, in particular self-evaluation
skills, will allow learners to take responsibility for seeking feedback and identifying action
points for improvement in their own performance. This should help to develop confidence in
taking advice and in asking for direction and assistance where necessary.
Investigations are used throughout this course and lecturing staff should encourage learners
to use as many methods as possible to gain the information they need. Apart from the
teaching notes provided, learners should make full use of the internet, journals (online and
paper-based), books, national and local papers, friends or family who have knowledge or
experience of the energy sector, site visits, practical demonstrations, and experimentation.
Presentations are also frequently used in this course. Learners should be encouraged to use
their creativity skills to develop a range of skills in presenting information, this could include a
talk, flipcharts, whiteboard (electronic), computer software, practical demonstrations, digital
pictures, video clips (using a mobile phone or camcorder).
Teaching staff should emphasise the need for learners to try and develop their own ideas to
solve problems or issues; these can then be used as points for discussion. Giving learners
the solution should not be seen as the first option. Learners should be encouraged to play an
active part in their own learning by discussing their views and thoughts on the technologies
being used, the environment, careers and personal preferences with peers and teaching
staff.
Guidance on approaches to assessment
Throughout the course, the need for correct preparation for practical activities should be
stressed. However, such preparation should not take excessive time to complete. Teaching
correct skills practice, effective and safe use of tools and equipment, and a positive view of
health and safety should help to ensure that preparation for practical work is comprehensive.
Learners will require supervision during practical work — both on a skills level and for health
and safety reasons. The learning environment should be designed to minimise risks and
provide a safe context for carrying out tasks. For example, when undertaking the task of
soldering, learners should be made aware of the risk from heat and fumes to themselves and
others.
It is recommended that each practical session be preceded by a ‘tool box’ talk on an aspect
of health and safety relevant to the work in hand. It is recommended that learners be given
regular but short practice sessions in the correct and safe working principles of the materials
to be used in each session, as well as coaching in the correct use of associated tools and
equipment.October 2018, version 3.0
16
Centres are encouraged to establish links with local industry. Local engineering companies,
trades associations, Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) and Engineering or Energy Institutes
may be prepared to offer support, for example, in the form of visits from representatives of
their organisations. Visitors from the energy industry will be able to give learners a realistic
view of jobs and conditions within the energy sector.
Centres should try and arrange a visit to an energy generation facility as part of the
learners’ learning experience and assessment. Visits to local sites are often particularly
useful to give learners a feel for the environment, equipment, and staff working and
using energy generation systems.
Site visits should be carefully arranged, organised and authorised. Due regard should be
placed on insurance arrangements, necessary when taking students on these visits,
particularly when going on to industrial sites.
Teaching and learning approaches should impart enthusiasm and help to inform learners of
realistic prospects in the energy industries. They should become aware of steps to
employment or further training. Through their experiences of the various practical skills and
knowledge of various energy systems in the course, they should become better equipped to
make valid personal choices regarding careers and further study.
A holistic approach to the course delivery and assessment should be adopted. The types of
energy generation methods and plant/systems contained within the Energy: An Introduction
(National 5) unit should form the basis of the practical units Energy: Domestic Wind Turbine
Systems (National 5) and Energy: Domestic Solar Hot Water Systems (National 5). Energy:
Employability and Careers (National 5) unit should be central to the whole course and
delivered alongside the other units.
Opportunities for e-assessment
E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this course. By e-assessment
we mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology
(ICT), such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to
use e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence
and that conditions of assessment as specified in the evidence requirements are met,
regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
Opportunities for developing Core Skills
Learners will be encouraged to learn through practical activity with workshop skills, and
practical lab work, forming a main type of delivery. The development of Core Skills and
employability skills should be uppermost in the minds of those considering how to plan
lessons. Learners should be encouraged to accept responsibility for learning and ownership
of the review and self-evaluation process. The Energy: Employability and Careers (National
5) unit, in particular, will actively encourage learners to analyse their strengths and
weaknesses with regard to the employability skills identified within the course units and
review their own performance through self-reflection and self-evaluation. Tasks involving
investigations into energy systems and the effects these energy systems have on individuals
or the environment should be incorporated throughout the course. This approach will
encourage development in the use of information technology as a tool for information
gathering and analysis, independent working, and investigation skills.October 2018, version 3.0
17
Opportunities to develop aspects of Core Skills should be used where they arise naturally.
For example, in order to carry out activities in a workshop environment, learners will develop
aspects of numeracy when making calculations and taking measurements. They will also
have to communicate simple science/engineering/construction terms with tutors and fellow
learners regarding skills practices, materials and tools, health and safety, and working
together in the workplace. They will have to work in a team during the practical units; it is
important that they realise what the positive attitudes are to ensure good team working
dynamics. Aspects of Problem Solving will arise through their participation in practical work.
This course gives automatic certification of Working with Others at SCQF level 4, Critical
Thinking at SCQF level 4, and Planning and Organising at SCQF level 4.October 2018, version 3.0

Links to National Occupational Standards
National Occupational Standards (NOS) are developed by the key employment sectors of the
United Kingdom. These standards set the competences required for job roles within a
particular employment sector.
The National 4 Skills for Work Engineering Skills course has been designed to link broadly to
NOS, but the standards required of first-year apprentices in the engineering industry are
significantly more onerous than those in this course.
Compared to NOS, this course requires either reduced scale and complexity, or more
achievable tolerances, and therefore provides a useful preparation for employment or further
training in the engineering industry. The general tolerance required for the practical activities
in this course should be ±3mm. The specific tolerances required for practical unit
assessments are specified in the assessment support packs (ASPs).
Further details are provided in the ‘Rationale’ section.
Equality and inclusion
This Course Arrangements Specification has been designed to ensure that there are no
unnecessary barriers to learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be
taken into account when planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or
considering alternative evidence. Further advice can be found on our website
www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.October 2018, version 3.0

Common rationale for Skills for Work Courses
Skills for Work Courses are designed to help learners to develop:
 skills and knowledge in a broad vocational area
 skills for learning, skills for life and skills for work
 Core Skills
 an understanding of the workplace
 positive attitudes to learning
 skills and attitudes for employability
A key feature of these courses is the emphasis on experiential learning. This means learning
through practical experience and learning by reflecting on experience.
Learning through practical experience
Teaching/learning programmes should include some or all of the following:
 learning in real or simulated workplace settings
 learning through role play activities in vocational contexts
 carrying out case study work
 planning and carrying out practical tasks and assignments
Learning through reflecting at all stages of the experience
Teaching/learning programmes should include some or all of the following:
 preparing and planning for the experience
 taking stock throughout the experience, reviewing and adapting as necessary
 reflecting after the activity has been completed, evaluating and identifying learning points
The Skills for Work Courses are also designed to provide learners with opportunities for
developing Core Skills, and Skills for Learning, Skills for Life and Skills for Work with a focus
on enhancing skills and attitudes for employability.October 2018, version 3.0

Assessment
Assessment objectives
Assessment across the units in this course will primarily test practical skills but will also
address the technical knowledge and understanding associated with those skills in
engineering at National 4. In particular, assessment will focus on:
 practical vocational skills
 skills for employment in an engineering context
Unit assessment
In all of the units that focus on the development of specific engineering skills, assessment
follows a similar pattern involving a range of practical activities which will produce evidence
for all the outcomes. The evidence will be confirmed by the use of an assessor checklist,
which will cover:
 interpretation of a drawing or specification
 the appropriate use of tools, materials and equipment
 successful involvement in the completion of a task, product or assembly
 quality checking of their work by the learner
 attention to health and safety aspects of working in a workshop type of environment
The assessment of employability skills is integrated in all of the units and is based on
assessor checklists and the completion of a learner review sheet on four different occasions
throughout the course. This review allows the learner to record development of employability
skills in the context of different skill areas.
Further details about unit assessment for this course can be found in the unit specifications
and the ASP materials.
Exemplification of possible assessment approaches for these units will be provided in the
ASP.
Quality assurance
All instruments of assessment used within this course should be internally verified, using the
appropriate policy within the centre and the guidelines set by SQA.
External verification will be carried out by SQA to ensure that internal assessment is within
the national guidelines for these qualifications.

Course support notes
Course support notes are not mandatory; they provide advice and guidance on approaches
to delivering and assessing the Skills for Work course. They are intended for teachers and
lecturers who are delivering the course and its units.
Guidance on approaches to delivery and assessment for this
course
The course has been designed to ensure that learners learn through practical experiences.
The main focus in each of the skills specific units is on practical work. General vocational
skills, such as selecting and maintaining tools and equipment, are integrated with practical
engineering activities within the units.
Health and safety is integral to all practical tasks and should be emphasised at the start of
and throughout each lesson.
Brief lessons on workshop protocol should also be included.
Teaching and learning approaches will include demonstrations of practical work by tutors.
Short lessons on specific aspects of industrial practice and the correct use of tools will prove
invaluable at intervals throughout the learning experience. These may be followed by brief
practical sessions in which the learners practise the skill emphasised by the demonstration.
Given the practical nature of teaching/learning and assessment, centres should ensure that
teaching blocks are of sufficient time to allow a meaningful experience for learners.
Reflecting on practical experiences and learning from them is an approach that is embedded
in the course. Throughout the learning experiences, the emphasis should be on helping
learners to develop an awareness of the employability skills and attitudes needed for the
engineering industry, for example, good time-keeping, co-operating with others, taking
instructions, and a positive attitude to learning. Opportunities to develop these skills and
attitudes arise naturally in the work of the course. Learners should be aware that these
generic skills are just as important as the practical engineering skills they are developing.
For example, it is important for workshop activities to be carried out to effective schedules;
learners will have opportunities to demonstrate good time-keeping in the context of these
schedules. Learners will have to co-operate with others regarding shared workspace, tools
and equipment. They will have to co-operate and communicate regarding the transfer of
materials, tools and equipment safely around and across the workshop. Learners will be
encouraged to develop a positive attitude to waste minimisation and environmental issues
regarding the use of materials.
The work of the course will increase awareness that health and safety issues are important in
the world of work generally and in engineering in particular.
In carrying out engineering activities, learners will learn that there are correct and incorrect
ways to use tools and equipment. Tutors will have ample opportunity to demonstrate good
practice and correct procedures to learners, who will learn the importance to self and others
of following instructions. Such positive experiences will foster a positive attitude to learning.October 2018, version 3.0
13
Teaching and learning approaches should impart enthusiasm and help to inform learners of
realistic prospects in the engineering sector or in industry generally. They should become
aware of steps to employment or further training. Through their experiences of the various
practical skills in the course, they should become better equipped to make valid personal
choices regarding careers and further study.
Sequencing/integration of units
The course has four mandatory units which offer a broad range of different engineering
experiences. It is recommended that the unit Engineering Skills: Mechanical (National 4) is
attempted and completed initially as some aspects of the content of this unit are incorporated
in all of the other course units. The Engineering Skills: Manufacture and Assembly
(National 4) unit should only be attempted after successful completion of the other three
units.
It is important that a well-planned induction to the course is delivered, emphasising its
integrated nature and stressing the importance of generic employability skills throughout.
Employability skills should span the course, allowing learners ample opportunity to develop
and review employability skills and attitudes over a range of engineering skills and over a
reasonable period of time.
Guidance on approaches to delivery
Throughout the course, the need for correct preparation for practical activities should be
stressed. However, such preparation should not take excessive time to complete. Teaching
correct skills practice, effective use of tools and equipment and a positive view of health and
safety should help to ensure that preparation for practical work is comprehensive.
Learners will require supervision during practical work — both on a skills level and for health
and safety reasons. The learning environment should be designed to minimise risks and
provide a safe context for carrying out tasks. For example, when undertaking the task of
Metal Active Gas (MAG) welding learners should be made aware of the risk from fire, fumes
and harmful rays to themselves and others.
It is recommended that each practical session be preceded by a ‘tool box’ talk on an aspect
of health and safety relevant to the work in hand. It is recommended that learners be given
regular but short practice sessions in the correct use of the materials to be used in each
session as well as coaching in the correct use of associated tools and equipment.
Centres are encouraged to establish links with local industry. Local engineering companies,
trades associations, Sector Skills Councils (SSCs), Institutes and Chambers of Commerce
may be prepared to offer support, for example, in the form of visits from representatives of
their organisations. Visitors from industry will be able to give learners a realistic view of jobs
and conditions in the engineering industry.
It may be possible for centres to arrange visits to engineering works as part of the learners’
learning experience. Visits to local industry are often particularly useful because work in
progress will be at different stages and learners can see various different trades working at
the same time. Industrial visits should be carefully arranged, organised and authorised. It
would be preferable for those responsible for such visits to have prior knowledge of the
industry in question.October 2018, version 3.0
14
Guidance on approaches to assessment
Approaches to assessment that promote the efficient and effective gathering of evidence are
to be encouraged.
The development and assessment of generic employability skills is a key feature of this
course and is integrated with the skills specific units. Learners can readily gather evidence
for assessment during their work in these practical skills units. Reviewing progress with
engineering employability skills and attitudes will take place in the practical context of work in
the different activities. Learners will complete a minimum of four review sheets in the different
trade activities. Assessment of interpreting drawings and specifications and materials should
also take place during the work in skills specific practical units. An employability skills profile
for the course is included and this gives a clear indication of where assessment evidence is
gathered for generic employability skills.
Within the skills specific practical units, the learner will produce evidence as a natural part of
the learning and teaching process. Learners will first learn and practise the correct
techniques and methods for each of the skills they undertake. Assessment of the various
practical tasks will take place at appropriate points throughout the course, allowing time for
learners to make quality checks of their finished products against the prescribed tolerances,
before being submitted for assessment.
In the Engineering Skills: Manufacture and Assembly (National 4) unit learners can if
appropriate work in teams of no more than three to manufacture and assemble an artefact. It
is expected that the artefact produced by such a team will be of sufficient complexity and
scope to allow all members of the team to make a contribution equal to the manufacture and
assembly of an artefact by an individual learner. The artefact manufactured by a team can
be, for example, a community-based project for the school, college or a youth group. Where
this occurs, each learner must identify their contribution to the completion of the task and
present evidence to satisfy the assessor that all outcomes and performance criteria have
been met.
Opportunities for e-assessment
E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this course. By e-assessment
we mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology
(ICT), such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to
use e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence
and that conditions of assessment as specified in the evidence requirements are met,
regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
Opportunities for developing Core Skills
Opportunities to develop aspects of Core Skills should be used where they arise naturally.
For example, in order to carry out engineering activities in a workshop environment, learners
will develop aspects of Numeracy when making engineering calculations and taking
measurements. They will also have to communicate simple engineering terms with tutors and
fellow learners regarding skills practices, materials and tools, health and safety and working
together in the workplace. Aspects of Problem Solving will arise through their participation in
practical work.October 2018, version 3.0
15
Teaching and learning approaches should encourage learners to take responsibility for their
own learning and development. In the practical units of the course, learners need to carry out
quality checks on their own work. This provides a good opportunity to motivate learners to
take pride in their work. The integration of employability skills, in particular self-evaluation
skills, will allow learners to take responsibility for seeking feedback and identifying action
points for improvement in their own performance. This should help to develop confidence in
taking advice and in asking for direction and assistance where necessary.
This course gives automatic certification of the Core Skill component Critical Thinking at
SCQF level 4. October 2018, version 3.0

Links to National Occupational Standards
National Occupational Standards (NOS) are developed by the key employment sectors of the
United Kingdom. These standards set the competences required for job roles within a
particular employment sector.
The National 4 Skills for Work Engineering Skills course has been designed to link broadly to
NOS, but the standards required of first-year apprentices in the engineering industry are
significantly more onerous than those in this course.
Compared to NOS, this course requires either reduced scale and complexity, or more
achievable tolerances, and therefore provides a useful preparation for employment or further
training in the engineering industry. The general tolerance required for the practical activities
in this course should be ±3mm. The specific tolerances required for practical unit
assessments are specified in the assessment support packs (ASPs).
Further details are provided in the ‘Rationale’ section.
Equality and inclusion
This Course Arrangements Specification has been designed to ensure that there are no
unnecessary barriers to learning or assessment. The individual needs of learners should be
taken into account when planning learning experiences, selecting assessment methods or
considering alternative evidence. Further advice can be found on our website
www.sqa.org.uk/assessmentarrangements.October 2018, version 3.0

 skills and knowledge in a broad vocational area
 skills for learning, skills for life and skills for work
 Core Skills
 an understanding of the workplace
 positive attitudes to learning
 skills and attitudes for employability
A key feature of these courses is the emphasis on experiential learning. This means learning
through practical experience and learning by reflecting on experience.
Learning through practical experience
Teaching/learning programmes should include some or all of the following:
 learning in real or simulated workplace settings
 learning through role play activities in vocational contexts
 carrying out case study work
 planning and carrying out practical tasks and assignments
Learning through reflecting at all stages of the experience
Teaching/learning programmes should include some or all of the following:

 Problem Solving
 Working with Others
Employability
The skills and attitudes for employability, including self-employment, are outlined below:
 generic skills/attitudes valued by employers
 understanding of the workplace and the employee's responsibilities, for example, time
keeping, appearance, customer care, etc
 self-evaluation skills
 positive attitude to learning
 flexible approaches to solving problems
 adaptability and positive attitude to change
 confidence to set goals, reflect and learn from experience
 specific vocational skills/knowledge
Course specifications highlight the links to NOS in the vocational area and identify
progression opportunities.
Opportunities for developing these skills and attitudes are highlighted in each of the course
and unit specifications. These opportunities include giving young people direct access to
workplace experiences or, through partnership arrangements, providing different learning
environments and experiences which simulate aspects of the workplace. These experiences
might include visits, visiting speakers, role play and other practical activities.
A Curriculum for Excellence (Scottish Executive 2004) identifies aspirations for every young
person. These are that they should become:
 successful learners
 confident individuals
 responsible citizens
 effective contributors
The learning environments, the focus on experiential learning and the opportunities to
develop employability, Skills for Learning, Skills for Life, Skills for Work and Core Skills in
these courses contribute to meeting these aspirations.October 2018, version 3.0

Summary of unit content
Units are statements of standards for assessment and not programmes of learning and
teaching. They can be delivered in a variety of ways; however Skills for Work units are
designed to provide an experiential learning process.
Engineering Skills: Mechanical (National 4)
This unit is designed to be the first attempted on the course. Learners are required to select
the correct tools and materials required to safely manufacture an artefact. During the
manufacture, learners will read simple engineering drawings, measure and mark, select
appropriate materials and work to specified tolerances. Embedded into the practical activities
of this unit are the employability skills that employers value. Although it is envisaged that all
employability skills will be developed in this unit, not all will be assessed.
Engineering Skills: Electrical/Electronic (National 4)
In this unit learners will select the correct tools and components required to construct a basic
functional extra low voltage electrical/electronic circuit from a given diagram and
specification. Embedded into the practical activities of this unit are the employability skills
that employers value. Although it is envisaged that all employability skills will be developed in
this unit, not all will be assessed.October 2018, version 3.0
8
Engineering Skills: Fabrication (National 4)
In this unit learners will select the correct tools, materials and equipment required to
manufacture an artefact using cutting, hot and cold forming and mechanical and thermal
joining techniques. Embedded into the practical activities of this unit are the employability
skills that employers value. Although it is envisaged that all employability skills will be
developed in this unit, not all will be assessed.
Engineering Skills: Manufacture and Assembly (National 4)
This unit is designed to be attempted only after successful completion of the preceding skills
units. Learners will select and safely use the correct tools and materials to manufacture,
assemble and complete functionality tests on an artefact. Learners will evaluate and report
their findings on the manufacture, assembly and functionality tests of the artefact. Embedded
into the practical activities of this unit are the employability skills that employers value.
Although it is envisaged that all employability skills will be developed in this unit, not all will
be assessed.
Conditions of award
To achieve the award of National 4 Skills for Work Engineering Skills, learners must achieve
all the required units as outlined in the course outline. They will be assessed pass/fail within
centres. Skills for Work Courses are not graded. October 2018, version 3.0

Assessment
Assessment objectives
Assessment across the units in this course will primarily test practical skills but will also
address the technical knowledge and understanding associated with those skills in
engineering at National 4. In particular, assessment will focus on:
 practical vocational skills
 skills for employment in an engineering context
Unit assessment
In all of the units that focus on the development of specific engineering skills, assessment
follows a similar pattern involving a range of practical activities which will produce evidence
for all the outcomes. The evidence will be confirmed by the use of an assessor checklist,
which will cover:
 interpretation of a drawing or specification
 the appropriate use of tools, materials and equipment
 successful involvement in the completion of a task, product or assembly
 quality checking of their work by the learner
 attention to health and safety aspects of working in a workshop type of environment
The assessment of employability skills is integrated in all of the units and is based on
assessor checklists and the completion of a learner review sheet on four different occasions
throughout the course. This review allows the learner to record development of employability
skills in the context of different skill areas.
Further details about unit assessment for this course can be found in the unit specifications
and the ASP materials.
Exemplification of possible assessment approaches for these units will be provided in the
ASP.
Quality assurance
All instruments of assessment used within this course should be internally verified, using the
appropriate policy within the centre and the guidelines set by SQA.
External verification will be carried out by SQA to ensure that internal assessment is within
the national guidelines for these qualifications.

Course support notes
Course support notes are not mandatory; they provide advice and guidance on approaches
to delivering and assessing the Skills for Work course. They are intended for teachers and
lecturers who are delivering the course and its units.
Guidance on approaches to delivery and assessment for this
course
The course has been designed to ensure that learners learn through practical experiences.
The main focus in each of the skills specific units is on practical work. General vocational
skills, such as selecting and maintaining tools and equipment, are integrated with practical
engineering activities within the units.
Health and safety is integral to all practical tasks and should be emphasised at the start of
and throughout each lesson.
Brief lessons on workshop protocol should also be included.
Teaching and learning approaches will include demonstrations of practical work by tutors.
Short lessons on specific aspects of industrial practice and the correct use of tools will prove
invaluable at intervals throughout the learning experience. These may be followed by brief
practical sessions in which the learners practise the skill emphasised by the demonstration.
Given the practical nature of teaching/learning and assessment, centres should ensure that
teaching blocks are of sufficient time to allow a meaningful experience for learners.
Reflecting on practical experiences and learning from them is an approach that is embedded
in the course. Throughout the learning experiences, the emphasis should be on helping
learners to develop an awareness of the employability skills and attitudes needed for the
engineering industry, for example, good time-keeping, co-operating with others, taking
instructions, and a positive attitude to learning. Opportunities to develop these skills and
attitudes arise naturally in the work of the course. Learners should be aware that these
generic skills are just as important as the practical engineering skills they are developing.
For example, it is important for workshop activities to be carried out to effective schedules;
learners will have opportunities to demonstrate good time-keeping in the context of these
schedules. Learners will have to co-operate with others regarding shared workspace, tools
and equipment. They will have to co-operate and communicate regarding the transfer of
materials, tools and equipment safely around and across the workshop. Learners will be
encouraged to develop a positive attitude to waste minimisation and environmental issues
regarding the use of materials.
The work of the course will increase awareness that health and safety issues are important in
the world of work generally and in engineering in particular.
In carrying out engineering activities, learners will learn that there are correct and incorrect
ways to use tools and equipment. Tutors will have ample opportunity to demonstrate good
practice and correct procedures to learners, who will learn the importance to self and others
of following instructions. Such positive experiences will foster a positive attitude to learning.October 2018, version 3.0
13
Teaching and learning approaches should impart enthusiasm and help to inform learners of
realistic prospects in the engineering sector or in industry generally. They should become
aware of steps to employment or further training. Through their experiences of the various
practical skills in the course, they should become better equipped to make valid personal
choices regarding careers and further study.
Sequencing/integration of units
The course has four mandatory units which offer a broad range of different engineering
experiences. It is recommended that the unit Engineering Skills: Mechanical (National 4) is
attempted and completed initially as some aspects of the content of this unit are incorporated
in all of the other course units. The Engineering Skills: Manufacture and Assembly
(National 4) unit should only be attempted after successful completion of the other three
units.
It is important that a well-planned induction to the course is delivered, emphasising its
integrated nature and stressing the importance of generic employability skills throughout.
Employability skills should span the course, allowing learners ample opportunity to develop
and review employability skills and attitudes over a range of engineering skills and over a
reasonable period of time.
Guidance on approaches to delivery
Throughout the course, the need for correct preparation for practical activities should be
stressed. However, such preparation should not take excessive time to complete. Teaching
correct skills practice, effective use of tools and equipment and a positive view of health and
safety should help to ensure that preparation for practical work is comprehensive.
Learners will require supervision during practical work — both on a skills level and for health
and safety reasons. The learning environment should be designed to minimise risks and
provide a safe context for carrying out tasks. For example, when undertaking the task of
Metal Active Gas (MAG) welding learners should be made aware of the risk from fire, fumes
and harmful rays to themselves and others.
It is recommended that each practical session be preceded by a ‘tool box’ talk on an aspect
of health and safety relevant to the work in hand. It is recommended that learners be given
regular but short practice sessions in the correct use of the materials to be used in each
session as well as coaching in the correct use of associated tools and equipment.
Centres are encouraged to establish links with local industry. Local engineering companies,
trades associations, Sector Skills Councils (SSCs), Institutes and Chambers of Commerce
may be prepared to offer support, for example, in the form of visits from representatives of
their organisations. Visitors from industry will be able to give learners a realistic view of jobs
and conditions in the engineering industry.
It may be possible for centres to arrange visits to engineering works as part of the learners’
learning experience. Visits to local industry are often particularly useful because work in
progress will be at different stages and learners can see various different trades working at
the same time. Industrial visits should be carefully arranged, organised and authorised. It
would be preferable for those responsible for such visits to have prior knowledge of the
industry in question.October 2018, version 3.0
14
Guidance on approaches to assessment
Approaches to assessment that promote the efficient and effective gathering of evidence are
to be encouraged.
The development and assessment of generic employability skills is a key feature of this
course and is integrated with the skills specific units. Learners can readily gather evidence
for assessment during their work in these practical skills units. Reviewing progress with
engineering employability skills and attitudes will take place in the practical context of work in
the different activities. Learners will complete a minimum of four review sheets in the different
trade activities. Assessment of interpreting drawings and specifications and materials should
also take place during the work in skills specific practical units. An employability skills profile
for the course is included and this gives a clear indication of where assessment evidence is
gathered for generic employability skills.
Within the skills specific practical units, the learner will produce evidence as a natural part of
the learning and teaching process. Learners will first learn and practise the correct
techniques and methods for each of the skills they undertake. Assessment of the various
practical tasks will take place at appropriate points throughout the course, allowing time for
learners to make quality checks of their finished products against the prescribed tolerances,
before being submitted for assessment.
In the Engineering Skills: Manufacture and Assembly (National 4) unit learners can if
appropriate work in teams of no more than three to manufacture and assemble an artefact. It
is expected that the artefact produced by such a team will be of sufficient complexity and
scope to allow all members of the team to make a contribution equal to the manufacture and
assembly of an artefact by an individual learner. The artefact manufactured by a team can
be, for example, a community-based project for the school, college or a youth group. Where
this occurs, each learner must identify their contribution to the completion of the task and
present evidence to satisfy the assessor that all outcomes and performance criteria have
been met.
Opportunities for e-assessment
E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this course. By e-assessment
we mean assessment which is supported by Information and Communication Technology
(ICT), such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or social software. Centres which wish to
use e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all learner evidence
and that conditions of assessment as specified in the evidence requirements are met,
regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. The most up-to-date guidance on the use of
e-assessment to support SQA’s qualifications is available at www.sqa.org.uk/e-assessment.
Opportunities for developing Core Skills
Opportunities to develop aspects of Core Skills should be used where they arise naturally.
For example, in order to carry out engineering activities in a workshop environment, learners
will develop aspects of Numeracy when making engineering calculations and taking
measurements. They will also have to communicate simple engineering terms with tutors and
fellow learners regarding skills practices, materials and tools, health and safety and working
together in the workplace. Aspects of Problem Solving will arise through their participation in
practical work.October 2018, version 3.0
15
Teaching and learning approaches should encourage learners to take responsibility for their
own learning and development. In the practical units of the course, learners need to carry out
quality checks on their own work. This provides a good opportunity to motivate learners to
take pride in their work. The integration of employability skills, in particular self-evaluation
skills, will allow learners to take responsibility for seeking feedback and identifying action
points for improvement in their own performance. This should help to develop confidence in
taking advice and in asking for direction and assistance where necessary.
This course gives automatic certification of the Core Skill component Critical Thinking at
SCQF level 4. October 2018, version 3.0
16
General information for learners
The National 4 Skills for Work Engineering Skills course focuses on four broad areas of
engineering — mechanical, electrical/electronic, fabrication and manufacture.
You will learn the basic skills across these areas by the:
 Interpretation of a drawing or specification.
 Appropriate use of tools, materials and equipment.
 Successful involvement in the completion of a task, product or assembly.
 Quality checking of your own work.
 Attention to health and safety aspects of working in a workshop type of environment.
Integrated throughout the course is the development of generic employability skills valued by
employers in an engineering sector. Your assessor will use checklists and you will complete
a learner review sheet on four different occasions throughout the course.
The National 4 Skills for Work Engineering Skills course provides a basis for progression into
further education or for moving directly into training in employment within an engineering
sector. October 2018, version 3.0

6What is a digital question paper?
A digital question paper is a digitised version of the question paper that can be completed
electronically using a PC, laptop, or tablet. Digital question papers are produced in Portable
Document Format (PDF), an open standard file format compatible with many software
applications, operating systems, and hardware platforms.
Like physical question papers, digital question papers are either in the combined question and
answer format or the question only format. The combined question and answer format digital
question papers have answer spaces enabled within the file for completion. The question only
format digital question papers have an associated digital answer booklet. Digital answer
booklets are produced in PDF format and Microsoft Word format. Both formats have answer
spaces enabled within the file for completion.
Combined question and answer format digital question paper

Who can use a digital question paper?
Digital question papers can only be used by disabled candidates and those identified as having
additional support needs who have an approved assessment arrangement. Digital question
papers may be suitable for candidates who have difficulty reading the physical question paper
or who have difficulty writing their responses on the physical question paper or answer booklet.
Candidates use a PC, laptop, or tablet to access digital question papers. This enables them to
adjust the colour of the paper and the text, and, to read and respond to questions, in conjunction
with a range of other assistive technologies.
Any candidates using information and communication technology (ICT) to complete their
question papers can use a digital answer booklet. Digital answer booklets are available on our
digital question papers website.
Further information on assessment arrangements can be found on our assessment
arrangements website.
23
What hardware and software do my centre need to use
digital question papers?
Hardware
To use digital question papers your centre will require a PC or laptop or tablet. We recommend
that PCs and laptops are running Windows. We recommend that tablets are iPads. Digital
question papers must be printed at the end of the exam, so your centre will also require a
printer.
Chromebooks
We asked CALL Scotland to investigate the use of Chromebooks for assessment arrangements,
including digital question papers. CALL Scotland’s report, published in 2020, is available on the
Chromebook section of the CALL Scotland website. The report highlights that currently, there is
no satisfactory solution for accessing and using our digital question papers on a Chromebook.
We are actively investigating this issue, but until we have a satisfactory solution, we do not
advocate the use of Chromebooks to access and use our digital question papers for the 2022
exam diet.
Software
To use digital question papers your centre will require an application that can read PDFs. The
most widely used free application is Adobe Acrobat Reader, but many other free and paid-for
applications are available.
To use the Microsoft Word digital answer booklets your centre will require Microsoft Word or
another application that can read Microsoft Word documents.
Many assistive technology applications are available. Depending on the needs of your
candidates, you may need to investigate which assistive technology applications you require.
More detailed advice and guidance on hardware, software, and assistive technology can be
found on the setting up and using digital exams section of the CALL Scotland website.4
How does my centre request digital question papers?
Digital question papers must be requested using the Assessment Arrangements Request (AAR)
system. We issue access details and instructions for using the AAR system to your centre’s
SQA Co-ordinator each year.
Requests for digital question papers must be submitted by the date specified in our Delivering
National Qualifications Key Dates document. This enables us to produce, collate, and distribute
all digital question papers to all centres in time for the exam diet.
How does SQA create digital question papers?
We can only begin creating a digital question paper once the physical question paper has been
through all its quality assurance stages and has been signed off as approved for the exam.
Our skilled staff use specialist software to convert the physical question paper file into a digital
question paper, adding bookmarks for sections, parts, and questions. For combined question
and answer format digital question papers, they also create answer boxes and spaces where
answer lines or spaces appear in the physical question paper.
Our staff then check the digital question paper against the physical question paper and check
that bookmarks are correct, and that answer boxes and spaces have been added correctly. We
create two versions of question-and-answer format digital question papers. One has spell
checking enabled and one has spell checking disabled.
A similar process is used to create digital answer booklets. We create two versions of PDF
digital answer booklets. One has spell checking enabled and one has spell checking disabled.
We also create a Word digital answer booklet.
We duplicate digital question paper files and associated digital answer booklet files on CD. We
gather all the requests for digital question papers from all centres and collate, package, and
distribute the digital question paper CDs to centres in advance of the exam diet.5
How can candidates practise using digital question
papers?
Your candidates must
 Practise using digital question papers, including under exam conditions, before they sit an
exam during the exam diet using a digital question paper.
 Be familiar with the PC, laptop or tablet they are using to access a digital question paper.
 Be familiar with the software they are using to access a digital question paper, and any
functionality within the software they are using.
 Be familiar with any assistive technologies they are using with digital question papers.
We make all our digital question papers available on our website after the exam diet. As with
physical past question papers, these are available for five years. Our digital answer booklets are
available on our website. As these contain no confidential question content, they are available
permanently, although they may, on occasion, be updated. You can access past digital question
papers and digital answer booklets on our digital question papers website. We recommend that
your candidates practise using past digital question papers and digital answer booklets.
You may wish to create your own digital question papers. Advice and guidance on this can be
found on the making digital prelim papers section of the CALL Scotland website.Where can I get further information on digital question
papers?

How to generate evidence
Introduction
The Scottish Qualifications Authority’s system of assessment measures the
evidence of a candidate’s attainment of knowledge, understanding and skills
against defined criteria. The assessment process must allow for evidence of
each candidate’s performance to be generated and collected. This evidence
must then be judged against the standards set out in the Unit specification. To
achieve the Unit the candidate must successfully meet the standards and there
must be evidence to prove this.
The Unit specification defines the criteria you need to use to judge whether or
not the candidate has met the standards. All Units have the following:
Outcomes
These tell you what the candidate actually has to do.
Knowledge and/or skills
This section details the essential knowledge and skills which the candidate must
attain in order to achieve each Outcome, combination of Outcomes or for the
Unit as a whole.
Evidence Requirements
Evidence Requirements can be written for each Outcome, for a combination of
Outcomes, or for the Unit as a whole. There is no standard format for writing
Evidence Requirements. Provided that they state clearly and unambiguously
the type, standard and amount of evidence which candidates have to produce in
order to be judged competent, the Evidence Requirements can be written in the
format which will be most easily understood by users of the Unit.
Note: The national standard of achievement expected, which was previously
specified as Performance Criteria, is now stated in the Evidence Requirements.
Where it is not possible to cover all the items listed under knowledge and/or
skills through holistic assessment, sampling can be used as a method of
gaining additional evidence. Sampling may also sometimes be an appropriate
method of assessing very knowledge-based Units. This type of assessment
must always be carried out in supervised conditions.
Where sampling is used, the Evidence Requirements must clearly state:
The standard of evidence required for each knowledge and/or skills item
so that satisfactory performance can be judged whichever items are
sampled on any one occasion.
The proportion of knowledge and/or skills which can be sampled.Guidance note: Introduction and How to Generate Evidence
Scottish Qualifications Authority Assessment Exemplars for Higher National Units
4
Whether any item(s) must be included in each assessment, ie if it is crucial
to the achievement of the Outcome(s) or to an embedded Core Skill.
The fact that a different sample should be chosen on each assessment
occasion to prevent candidates being able to foresee what they will be
asked.
The conditions of assessment.
Assessment guidelines
This section should give guidance on how best to conduct the assessment to
generate the evidence required, eg recommending the use of a particular
assessment instrument. It should include guidance on how to integrate the
assessment of the whole Outcome or, if appropriate, how to link assessment
holistically with other Outcomes in the Unit. Like Evidence Requirements,
assessment guidelines can be written for each Outcome, a combination of
Outcomes, or for the Unit as a whole.
It is important to realise that it is up to the assessor to judge when and if the
candidate has satisfactorily met the standards. This decision should be based
on the quality and correct quantity of evidence collected, set against the
standards in the Unit.
The assessment instrument in this pack should not create any unnecessary
barriers to achievement for open/distance learning delivery and the additional
support needs of individual candidates should be taken into account. You may
need to adapt it so that you can assess candidates with additional support
needs or candidates who are undertaking the Unit on an open/distance learning
basis. However, whilst taking into account the needs of the candidate
concerned, the methods of assessment you choose must still be valid, reliable
and practicable. If you have any questions or problems, or if you are in any
doubt as to whether or not the alternative assessment you have chosen is still
valid, please telephone the Business Development and Customer Support
Team at the Scottish Qualifications Authority on: 0303 333 0330.
Core Skills
The Unit specification will detail the Core Skills covered within the Unit. Where
Core Skills have been embedded in a Unit specification and an assessor wishes
to use an alternative method of assessment, she/he must ensure that the
assessment generates the Evidence Requirements specified in the Unit
specification. It is recommended that the centre seek prior verification for t

Instructions to person nominated to operate sound equipment
This guidance relates to carrying out a check of the CD. If your centre has opted to receive
electronic audio files you must refer to the guidance on Downloading and Securely Storing
Electronic Files which will have been issued to the nominated people in your centre.
1 Arrangements for the exam
a) Recordings will be supplied on CD or electronically via SQA’s secure site.
b) You should check the room(s) to be used for the examination and the sound equipment
before the day of the examination.
• The room(s) used for the examination should be sufficiently isolated from any other room
in which an examination is being held so that other candidates will not be disturbed by
the sound of the recording.
• The sound equipment should be in satisfactory working order.
• The sound equipment should be suited to the size of the room(s) used and/or to the
number of candidates in a group.
• The optimum number of candidates in each group, and the best position for the sound
equipment so that all candidates can hear clearly, should be determined by practical
experiment.
c) You are required to conduct a check of the CD prior to the examination. You will be admitted
to the examination room 30 minutes before the start of the exam.
d) When you receive the CD from the invigilator, check to ensure that it states the correct
subject, level, date and time of the exam.
e) You should play a short section of the recording to check for any faults and to adjust
volume and tone as necessary.
f) No candidate is to be present or within earshot during the recording check or admitted to the
room until the check has been completed.
g) On completion of the check, inform the invigilator that the CD is working correctly and is
ready to play. Remain in the examination room to operate the equipment for the
examination. While you are in the examination room you must not communicate with the
candidates.2
2 Emergency procedure
If there is an issue playing the CD, it must first be tried on another machine. If the CD proves
faulty and unusable, you must tell the invigilator who will inform the SQA co-ordinator who will
contact SQA. Follow any further instructions from the invigilator.
3 Conduct of the exam
a) Start playing the CD when the invigilator asks.
b) The CD must be left to play through without interruption*. No part of the CD may be
repeated, unless specifically authorised by the invigilator.
c) In the event of an interruption which might seriously affect the candidates’ hearing of the
recording the invigilator may ask you to pause the CD until the interruption has passed. The
invigilator may ask you to take the recording back a few seconds or to the start of a section.
Please note that if the CD is stopped, it will return to the first track. Therefore, it should be
paused.
d) When the CD has been played through, you should pass the CD to the invigilator and leave
the room.
*If candidates have been given an allowance of extra time, there may be a requirement to
pause the CD. Please refer to the Sound Equipment Extra Time Operator’s Instructions for the
relevant subject/level.

        Modified past papers

        Some of the 2022 and 2023 past papers are labelled 'modified'. This means SQA made changes to the question paper in response to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, as part of our modifications to assessment in National Courses. For example, a modified past paper may be shorter, have fewer marks or contain fewer topics than past papers from previous years.
        Specimen question papers

        Specimen question papers are available for National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher qualifications. These show what a question paper looks like - how it is structured and the types of questions it contains. They also include marking instructions. Find them under 'Past Papers and Marking Instructions' on our NQ subject pages.

        Your Scottish Candidate number

        Your Scottish Candidate Number (SCN) is your personal identification number.

            You need to write it on your exam answer booklets.
            Your school can tell you what your SCN is.

        Your teacher will give you an SCN card to write your name, school name, date of birth and SCN on. You can take this card into the exam room as long as you don’t write anything else on it.
        Check your school has the right name and address

        Has your address changed?

        If any of your personal details change, or are going to change over the summer, you must tell your school before you finish for the summer holidays.

        You can check the personal details we hold for you by logging in to MySQA.

        Desks

        If your school allocates a specific desk for exams, make sure you know what desk number is yours for each exam.
        Prohibited items

        You must not take any prohibited item to your seat. You're not allowed (unless an approved assessment arrangement is in place):

            Mobile phones (even if it's switched off)
            Electronic devices such as tablets, earbuds, smartwatches or any other device that stores information or can connect to the internet
            Books, sketches or paper, and anything written on your clothes or body
            Pencil cases or calculator cases
            Calculators (except when allowed)
            Dictionaries (except when allowed)
            Notes

        Check your bags and pockets to make sure you do not have any of these things with you - plan ahead and leave them in a safe place.

        When specific items are allowed in an exam, you must make sure they meet SQA regulations.

        You are not allowed to share any equipment during an exam.
        Invigilators

        Invigilators supervise the exam and make sure the rules are followed. Follow any instructions given by the invigilator and ask them for help if you feel unwell or upset.
        Leaving the exam room

        If you finish early or have done as much of the exam as you can, and you want to leave the exam room, raise your hand and ask the invigilator for permission to leave. If the exam is longer than one hour, the invigilator may allow you to leave after 30 minutes. If the exam is less than one hour, you must stay in the exam room until the end of the exam.

        Before you leave, you must give the invigilator all your exam papers, including any answer booklets, extra sheets, question papers and data booklets. You could lose all marks for the paper concerned if you don’t give your exam papers to the invigilator before leaving the exam room.
        Question papers and answer booklets

            Read the instructions on the front of your question paper
            Check the subject and level are correct
            Fill in your details on the front page - including your name, school name and SCN

        You will get either a :

            combined question paper and answer booklet

        or

            separate question paper and answer booklet

        Work through the question paper until you see the statement END OF QUESTION PAPER.

        In a question paper, pages that don’t have any questions or instructions will say BLANK PAGE on them.

        No page is completely blank. If you find a completely blank page before the END OF QUESTION PAPER statement, tell the invigilator.
        Extra paper

        If you need extra paper, raise your hand and ask the invigilator.

        If you use extra paper, you must write your name, SCN and school name on each sheet and put these inside your answer booklet.

        In some subjects, you will find extra pages or graph paper at the end of the answer booklet.
        Writing your answers

        You must use a pen with black or blue ink.

        Do not use gel pens or pencils as these can fade.

        It is important the markers can read your writing. They might not be able to award marks if your writing is difficult to read.

        When writing on unlined pages, try to leave a space of about one centimetre between lines.

        In some subjects, poor spelling and punctuation could also result in marks not being awarded. If you have any concerns about this, or about your handwriting, speak to your teacher.

        Cross out any rough work, or any unwanted answers if you make more than one attempt at a question. You are not allowed to use correction pens, tape or fluid in any exam.
        Remember

            Take your time.
            Read the question carefully.
            Answer the question being asked.
            Double check your answers if you finish early.
            Stay calm and do your best.

        Using calculators and dictionaries

        You can only use calculators and dictionaries in specific subjects and levels.
        When can you use a calculator?

        Some learners may be allowed to use a calculator in the non-calculator papers for Mathematics or Applications of Mathematics, or for Gaelic Medium Matamataig or Gnìomhachas Matamataigs as part of an assessment arrangement. The calculator must be a basic calculator and not a scientific calculator. A basic calculator should perform the four basic arithmetic operations only and should not have the function to calculate the square root of a number. Please note that calculators containing the following keys are allowed: %, +/-, M-, M+, and MRC.

        Please speak to your teacher or lecturer if you have any questions about the type of calculator allowed.

        Conduct

        Everyone should have a fair chance to do their best during exams.

        Cheating and causing a disturbance during an exam are unfair to other candidates. Examples of cheating and unfair behaviour include:

            Having prohibited items with you
            Pretending to be someone else or getting someone else to take an exam for you.
            Disruptive behaviour in the exam room.
            Using rude, abusive, offensive or discriminatory language or images in your answers.
            Copying from another person.
            Collusion - working with other candidates on an individual task that must be your own work.
            Plagiarism - failing to reference sources properly or presenting someone else’s work as your own, which includes using artificial intelligence programmes such as ChatGPT to create responses.

        Any cheating or unfair behaviour can have serious consequences for your results.

        This could include losing marks, getting a lower grade or having your qualification cancelled. Your school can explain more about this.
        Exam day checklist
        Do

            Do arrive in good time - at least 10 minutes before the exam starts.
            Do bring the right equipment - including black or blue ink pens.
            Do check that you don’t have any prohibited items with you at your seat.
            Do check you have been given the correct exam paper.
            Do put your name, SCN and the name of your school on every piece of work you hand in (including separate answer booklets and answer sheets).
            Do write legibly so markers can read your answers.
            Do read instructions and listen carefully for any announcements from the invigilator.
            Do cross out any rough work that is not part of your answer.
            Do stay in the room until the exam is finished. You can only leave early with permission from the invigilator.
            Do give the invigilator all your exam papers, including any answer booklets, extra sheets, question papers and data booklets, before you leave the exam room.

        Don't

            Don’t get someone else to sit your exam for you or pretend to be someone else.
            Don’t take any prohibited items to your seat.
            Don’t behave in a disruptive way or cause a disturbance.
            Don’t copy from anyone else.
            Don’t share your work with anyone else.
            Don’t share equipment with anyone else.
            Don’t use any rude, abusive, offensive or discriminatory language or images in your answers.
            Don’t use correction pens, tape or fluid.

        After your exam
        What if I couldn't sit the exam?

        You or your parent or carer should contact your school as soon as possible, explaining what has happened.

        They will be able to discuss your options and whether or not you would be entitled to use the Examination Exceptional Circumstances Consideration Service. If you are eligible for the service, your school would need to contact us.
        Exam Exceptional Circumstances Consideration Service

        This Service will support you if:

            you have been unable to attend the exam, or prevented from completing the exam, due to a personal circumstance beyond your control (such as a medical issue)
            you have been affected during the exam by a disruption, or other exam circumstance, reported by the chief invigilator
            your performance in the exam was affected by a personal circumstance, or an unplanned incident on the day, which was beyond your control.

        Exam nerves, distraction or loss of concentration during an exam are not valid reasons to use this service.

        Your school must request the service for you within 10 days after the exam, so it’s important that you speak to them as soon as possible after the exam, giving them the information about what happened. You must give your school permission to request the service.

        Your school will then need to provide alternative evidence based on the assessments you completed throughout the year. This could be prelims, class tests, class work, records of performances (in some subjects). SQA examiners will review this, and any exam materials that you completed, to decide your grade.

        If you use the EECCS, the grade you are awarded may be different from the estimated grade provided by your school. You will not be able to appeal against your grade through the appeals service.

        More on the exceptional circumstances service.

        Completing your coursework

        There are rules you must follow when you are completing your coursework.

        Use the tabs below to open each section individually. Alternatively you can show all the sections.
        What types of coursework are there?

        The type of coursework you will do depends on what subject you are studying.

        These can be;

            A portfolio
            Practical activities
            Performances
            Assignments
            Projects

        Only hand in your own work

        You must only submit your own work. Passing off other people’s work and ideas as your own is called ‘plagiarism’ and it’s cheating.

        It’s not your own work if:

            all or some of it has been done, or worked on, by someone else
            it has been done by someone who has produced similar work in the past (such as an older student)
            you use work that your teacher has prepared as an example
            you’ve copied it from a source, such as a book, website or an essay bank, without trying to put it in your own words or referencing it
            you’ve copied text, images or any other material produced by an AI tool.

        Working with others

        Unless you are working as part of a group (for example, on a group project), you must work alone to complete your coursework. If someone asks you for help, you should tell them to ask a teacher instead.

        If you are finding any part of your course difficult, ask your teacher for advice. No other person can be involved, at any stage, in discussing or reviewing your coursework.
        How to use sources

        You may be able to use lots of different sources (including books, the internet and TV programmes) in your work, but it’s important that you reference them correctly.

        When using sources, the general rules are;

            Use ‘quotation marks’ around any text that has come from other sources and clearly say where that text is from.
            Provide a reference for any diagrams or illustrations you’ve used from other sources.
            Create a bibliography (a list of sources you have used). This will go at the end of your work.

        Your teacher will be able to help if you get stuck.
        Can I use Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

        No. You might have heard about or used artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT or Google Bard. Many of these AI tools have age restrictions, which means they are not suitable for everyone. The text they produce can be incorrect or contain biased information. As the information is not reliable, you must not use or reference AI tools as sources for your work.

        Find out more about our policy on AI in assessments.
        What if I break the rules?

        If an investigation finds you’ve broken any rules, there may be a penalty, which could include the following.

            Your marks can be reduced, or you can be awarded zero marks.
            Your qualification for that subject can be cancelled.

            Information for private candidates (home-schooled)

            Private candidates include home-schooled learners ­who are taught by a parent, carer, or tutor.

            If you are a private candidate and you wish to take SQA qualifications, you need to be entered for the qualifications by an SQA approved centre (such as a school, college, or training provider) that will act as your presenting centre.
            What does a presenting centre do?

            Your presenting centre will register you for your chosen qualifications and arrange for you to complete the required assessments, including any exams or coursework. They are also responsible for making sure that you complete your assessments under the conditions required by SQA – for example, under direct supervision or completing the assessment within a time limit.
            How do I find a presenting centre?

            You can contact your local schools, colleges and training providers and ask if they can act as your presenting centre. You can also approach your local authority education department. We strongly advise doing this as early as possible before the start of the academic year.

            When you contact a centre, make sure you provide them with details of the qualifications you are looking to be entered for, including your chosen subjects. The centre will advise if they are able to enter you for those qualifications.

            The centre may also arrange a discussion with you to find out more and to explain what’s involved.
            Is there anything I need to discuss with the centre?

            At an early stage, you should ask the centre about the assessments you will need to complete for your chosen qualifications. They will advise you what coursework and/or exams you will need to do and when these will take place.

            If you are disabled and/or have additional support needs, you should also discuss these with the centre as soon as possible, so that they can agree appropriate assessment arrangements with you and ensure they are put in place.
            If they agree to act as my presenting centre, what happens next?

            Once a centre has agreed to present you as a private candidate, they will ensure that you are registered with SQA and have a Scottish Candidate Number (SCN). The centre will enter you for your chosen qualifications and provide you with all the information you need to know about your assessments – including coursework, any tests or internal assessments that take place throughout the year, and details of any exams you will be sitting.

            They will also explain the rules and essential information you need to know about your coursework and assessments. It is important that you understand
            ntire year can be cancelled.

        Become a centre - offer your first SQA qualification

        To offer SQA qualifications you must first become an approved SQA centre. This ensures each organisation delivering SQA qualifications has the right set-up and meets quality standards to deliver for learners.

        Below you will find more information about the approval process.

        Our dedicated team are here to support you and your organisation through the process. You'll be assigned a point of contact who will answer any questions you may have and keep you up to date on the progress of your application.

        Approval application process
        Contact us

        Complete the enquiry form.
        Pre-application stage

        We’ll meet with you to discuss becoming an SQA Centre, including if it’s right for your organisation.

        If you would still like to apply after that, we’ll then send further information and carry out due diligence, including a soft finance check.
        Application stage

        Next, we send you the relevant documents and forms to apply for the two parts of approval:

            Systems approval – this confirms that your centre has management and systems needed to deliver, assess and internally verify SQA qualifications.
            Qualification approval – this confirms that your centre has the materials and resources to deliver, assess and internally verify SQA qualifications.

        Application review stage

        We’ll review your application. This includes:

            a centre approval meeting by a Quality Enhancement Manager and
            a subject approval meeting by a subject expert External verifier.

        After review, the Quality Enhancement Manager and External Verifier will submit a report and communicate any feedback and recommendations to you.
        Outcome - centre approval

        There are two possible outcomes: ‘approved’ or ‘not yet approved’.

            Approved - We’ll provide a centre operating agreement (COA), which you must sign and return to SQA. We then issue your centre number, and you can start registering candidates.

            Not yet approved - We’ll offer to help you re-apply.

            Modified past papers

            Some of the 2022 and 2023 past papers are labelled 'modified'. This means SQA made changes to the question paper in response to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, as part of our modifications to assessment in National Courses. For example, a modified past paper may be shorter, have fewer marks or contain fewer topics than past papers from previous years.
            Specimen question papers

            Specimen question papers are available for National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher qualifications. These show what a question paper looks like - how it is structured and the types of questions it contains. They also include marking instructions. Find them under 'Past Papers and Marking Instructions' on our NQ subject pages.

                General

                    Welcome to Personal Finance Award SCQF Level 6, fiston

                    Please select the module below to get started.

                    Introduction

                    This pack is designed for learners studying the Level 6 Personal Finance Award. The Award is made up of two units:

                    1.  Money Management

                    2.  Personal Finance in Action

                    To gain the Award learners must achieve both units.

                    Once learners have studied the content of the units, they will sit their final assessments via SQA’s on screen assessment system (SOLAR).


                    This pack is intended to help learners become familiar with the terms used in financial products and services and understand more about how they work and what they are used for before they sit their final assessment. Questions included in the final assessment will draw from the content of units one and two.

                    Learners can use the explanations and descriptions given within this pack as a starting point for further investigation into the various topics covered, or they can use it as a reminder of the various topics covered.



                    PLEASE NOTE

                    Where terms are defined in this document by giving examples of specific values that might apply, the values given are usually based on 2021-22 rates. For example: VAT; Income Tax Bands; Land and Buildings Transaction Tax rates; ISA savings limit; Capital Gains Tax threshold; etc. Learners must be aware that the government has the authority to increase or decrease tax and threshold rates each year depending on inflation and other economic, societal or political factors.
